# Implementation notes

Unexpected issues met while implementing [`tasks-plan.md`](tasks-plan.md), and
how they were solved. Newest entries go at the end of their task's section.
When a note changes a decision in the plan or the design, the same PR updates
that document too.

## T01: workspace skeleton

### reqwest 0.13 defaults to aws-lc-rs, not ring

**Issue.** The plan chose rustls on the `ring` provider. reqwest 0.13 made
`aws-lc-rs` its only built-in rustls provider: its `rustls` feature enables
`aws-lc-rs`, and the provider-free alternative, `rustls-no-provider`, panics
at `Client::new()` unless a provider is installed first (`reqwest`
`src/async_impl/client.rs`, `default_rustls_crypto_provider`). Staying on
`ring` would mean installing it before every client is built, including in
every library crate's tests.

**Solution.** Use reqwest's `rustls` feature, so `aws-lc-rs` is the one
provider in the tree. `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`
resolves to the same provider, and `cargo tree` shows no `ring`, `openssl-sys`
or `native-tls`. A probe build with reqwest, tokio-tungstenite, sqlx (SQLite)
and bollard compiled in 32 seconds on this machine. `aws-lc-sys` needs a C
compiler (and `cmake` on some targets), which the GitHub Ubuntu runners have.

Consequences:

- The workspace declares reqwest with `default-features = false` and only
  `json`, `form` and `query` (reqwest 0.13 made `form` and `query` opt-in
  features). Crates that talk HTTPS add the `rustls` feature. `agentctl` talks
  plain HTTP to `agentctl.internal` and doesn't, so its static musl build
  stays free of C code.
- T02's license policy has to allow the `OpenSSL` license for `aws-lc-sys`
  (its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND OpenSSL`) as a
  per-crate exception. (Superseded: current `aws-lc-sys` releases no longer
  use that license; see
  [T02](#aws-lc-sys-no-longer-needs-an-openssl-exception).)
- The plan's Libraries table and T02 are updated to match.

### cargo-llvm-cov ignores `default-members`

**Issue.** The plan relied on `default-members = [".", "crates/*"]` to make
the existing `cargo coverage` alias cover every crate. `cargo test` honors it,
and every crate's tests ran under coverage, but `cargo llvm-cov` still
reported only the root package's files. The gate would have measured
`src/lib.rs` alone.

**Solution.** Add `--workspace` to the `coverage` alias in
`.cargo/config.toml`, and to the CI step that prints the summary
(`cargo llvm-cov report --workspace --summary-only`). The report now lists
every crate.

## T02: dependency policy

### cargo-deny checks only the root package by default

**Issue.** The root `Cargo.toml` is a package as well as the workspace, not a
virtual manifest. For such a manifest cargo-deny makes the root package the
only root of the crate graph, so the member crates' dependencies are never
checked. The action's default arguments (`--all-features`) have this gap: a
throwaway commit adding `native-tls` to `agentd` passed `cargo deny check
bans`.

**Solution.** Pass `--workspace`, which makes every workspace member a root.
With it the same commit fails. cargo-deny has no configuration key for this,
so the CI job passes it through the action's `arguments`, and the README and
the header of `deny.toml` give the full local command. `all-features = true`
lives in `deny.toml`'s `[graph]` table, so local runs match CI without
repeating it. The job also passes `--locked`, so it checks the committed
`Cargo.lock` instead of silently re-resolving it.

### aws-lc-sys no longer needs an OpenSSL exception

**Issue.** The plan, following the T01 note, expected `aws-lc-sys` to need an
`OpenSSL` license exception. That was true up to `aws-lc-sys` 0.38. Since
0.39 its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND Apache-2.0 AND MIT AND
BSD-3-Clause AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT) AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT-0)`,
and `aws-lc-rs` 1.18, which reqwest 0.13.5 resolves to, requires
`aws-lc-sys` 0.45. An `OpenSSL` exception would never match, and cargo-deny
warns about unmatched exceptions.

**Solution.** No exception. The allowlist was derived from a scratch copy of
the workspace in which `agentd` depends on every crate in
`[workspace.dependencies]`, with reqwest's `rustls` feature, and each license
was kept only if removing it made `cargo deny --workspace check licenses`
fail. That gives MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause (`aws-lc-sys`, `matchit`,
`subtle`), ISC (`aws-lc-rs`, `aws-lc-sys`, `rustls-webpki`, `untrusted`),
Unicode-3.0 (the ICU crates and `unicode-ident`), Zlib (`foldhash`) and
CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (`webpki-root-certs`, pulled in by
`rustls-platform-verifier` through reqwest's `rustls` feature; `webpki-roots`
is not in the graph). BSD-2-Clause, which the plan listed, is not needed.
Today's lockfile uses only a few of these licenses, so `deny.toml` sets
`unused-allowed-license = "allow"` to keep CI free of warnings about the
rest.

### cargo-deny 0.20 has no warning level for unmaintained crates

**Issue.** The plan says `[advisories]` warns on unmaintained crates and that
`[licenses]` denies GPL, LGPL and AGPL. In cargo-deny 0.20 (the version the
action's `v2` tag ships) every advisory that applies is an error:
`unmaintained` only chooses the scope (`all`, `workspace`, `transitive`,
`none`) in which unmaintained advisories are reported at all. The
`[licenses] deny` list is deprecated and ignored: any license not in `allow`
or an exception is rejected.

**Solution.** `deny.toml` keeps `unmaintained = "all"`, and the CI job passes
`-W unmaintained` to `cargo deny check`, which lowers that one lint to a
warning. A scratch check with `paste` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436) passes with a
warning; one with `smallvec` 1.6.0 (RUSTSEC-2021-0003) still fails. GPL,
LGPL, AGPL and MPL-2.0 are rejected by being absent from `allow`; a scratch
path dependency carrying each of them failed `check licenses`, while
`MIT OR GPL-3.0-only` passed.

### The action's image ships Rust 1.85

**Issue.** `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2` runs in a `rust:1.85.0`
image, and cargo-deny runs that image's `cargo metadata`. Cargo 1.85 reads
today's manifests and lockfile, including the full dependency set, but it
predates the workspace's `rust-version` (1.98.1) and could fail on a
dependency that uses a newer manifest feature or edition.

**Solution.** The job sets the action's `rust-version: stable`, so the action
switches to the current stable toolchain before running cargo-deny, like the
other jobs.

### `[licenses.private]` exempts any unpublished crate

**Issue.** `[licenses.private] ignore = true` is meant to exempt our own
crates, which carry only `license-file`. cargo-deny applies it to every crate
with `publish = false`, wherever it comes from. A scratch copy of the
workspace in which `agentd` depends on `vendor/gpl`, a path crate with
`license = "GPL-3.0-only"` and `publish = false`, printed `licenses ok`.
cargo-deny has no setting that limits the exemption to workspace members:
`[licenses.private]` only adds private registries, `[sources]` does not see
path dependencies, and a `[[licenses.clarify]]` entry per workspace crate
would have to be added for every new crate and pinned to the hash of
`LICENSE`.

**Solution.** Keep `private.ignore` and add `scripts/ci/check-path-deps.sh`,
which the `deny` job runs before cargo-deny. It reads
`cargo metadata --locked --all-features --format-version 1` and fails when a
package with no source (a path package) has a manifest other than the root
`Cargo.toml` or `crates/<name>/Cargo.toml`. Matching the manifest path, not
the `workspace_members` list, also rejects a vendored crate added to
`[workspace] members` outside `crates/`. The same scratch case fails the
script, as do a path dependency outside the repository, an optional one
behind a feature, a Windows-only one, one nested under
`crates/agentd/vendor/`, and a `[patch.crates-io]` entry pointing at a local
copy; with a stale lockfile, `--locked` makes it fail too. A crate placed
directly in `crates/` is a workspace crate by the layout rules in
`AGENTS.md`, so it is reviewed as our code.

### The `deny` job ran only when code changed

**Issue.** The `deny` job runs only when the `changes` job classifies a
change as code. An advisory published against a crate already in
`Cargo.lock` therefore surfaced on the next code pull request, unrelated to
it, rather than when it was published.

**Solution.** The workflow gains a weekly `schedule` trigger (Mondays at
04:23 UTC). The `changes` job sets a base commit only for `pull_request` and
`push` events, so a scheduled run is classified as code and runs every job,
which also catches breakage from a new stable toolchain. `publish-badges`
still runs only on pushes to `main` and manual dispatches, and the `docs`
job's badge check only on pushes to `main`. Scheduled runs take a
concurrency group of their own: in `main`'s group, where
`cancel-in-progress` is false, a scheduled run arriving while a push run is
pending would cancel that pending run, and its badges would not be
published. GitHub runs schedules on the default branch only, so the trigger
takes effect once this workflow is on `main`. GitHub also disables
`schedule` triggers in a public repository after 60 days without repository
activity, so on a quiet repository the weekly advisory run can stop and has
to be re-enabled from the Actions tab.

## T03: core-types

### The `Surface` trait's `Sender` has no runtime to come from

**Issue.** The design's trait takes `tx: Sender<InboundEvent>`, which reads
as a `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender`. T03 limits core-types to `serde`,
`serde_json`, `uuid`, `time`, `thiserror` and `async-trait`, so no runtime's
channel is available. `std::sync::mpsc` blocks, which an async surface must
not do.

**Solution.** core-types defines `Sender<T>`, a cloneable handle over an
`Arc<dyn Sink<T>>`, where `Sink` is an `#[async_trait]` trait with one
method, `send(item) -> Result<(), SendError>`. The receiving side (agentd,
testkit's `MockSurface`) wraps its tokio sender in a small local type that
implements `Sink`. `SendError` converts to `SurfaceError::Closed`, so a
surface's event loop can end with `tx.send(event).await?`.

### `history` couldn't read a thread

**Issue.** The design's `history(&self, conv: &ConvRef, …)` names only a
conversation. Both of its callers read a thread: T23's turn message builder
("thread messages since the agent's last reply") and `agentctl history`
("more thread context"). Slack's `conversations.replies` and Rocket.Chat's
`chat.getThreadMessages` both need the thread root, which a `ConvRef` doesn't
carry.

**Solution.** `history` takes `thread: &ThreadKey`. A `ThreadKey` without a
root reads the conversation's top level, which is what a DM's continuous
session needs. The design's trait is updated to match. The rustdoc fixes the
order: at most `limit` messages, the newest ones older than `before`, oldest
first.

### `is_dm` couldn't tell a group DM from a channel

**Issue.** T22's router returns a `ScopeKind`, which has `GroupDm`, but
`InboundEvent` only had `is_dm: bool`. Nothing an event carried could produce
`GroupDm`.

**Solution.** `InboundEvent` has `conv_kind: ConvKind` (`Dm`, `GroupDm`,
`Channel`) instead, with an `is_dm()` method. T12 (Rocket.Chat room type `d`)
and T28 (Slack `channel_type`) are updated to set it.
`ScopeKey::for_conversation(kind, conv)` builds the matching scope.

### Key strings and separators inside platform ids

**Issue.** `dm:<surface>:<team>:<conv>` is ambiguous if an id contains `:`.
Slack's ids never do, but the Rocket.Chat "team" is whatever id agentd picks
for a server, and a `host:port` is a natural choice. A `/` in an id would
likewise break `VolumeKey`'s `<agent>/<scope>`.

**Solution.** Inside key strings, `%`, `:` and `/` in ids are written as
`%25`, `%3A` and `%2F`. Ids without them, which is every id Slack and
Rocket.Chat produce today, appear unchanged. Parsing accepts only what
`Display` writes (no lowercase or other escapes, and no raw `/`), and IDs
parse only in lowercase hyphenated form, so a key string that parses always
renders back to itself and one key never has two spellings in a database
column. A scope key never contains `/`, which keeps `VolumeKey`'s single
separator unambiguous; it is still not a safe file name (see
[below](#scope-keys-are-not-file-or-docker-names)). `MemberKey` and `ConvRef` have the same `<surface>:<team>:<id>` string form,
for columns such as T23's `requester_key`.

### `post` returns one `MsgRef`

**Issue.** T29's acceptance said `post` renders and splits through `render`,
but `post` returns a single `MsgRef`, and T23 records a `message_refs` row
for every chunk after calling `render` itself.

**Solution.** `Surface::post` sends one already-rendered chunk, as its
rustdoc says, and `Surface::render` does the converting and splitting. T29's
acceptance is reworded to test `render` instead.

### The scope lock had no lease id

**Issue.** `LockResponse::Held` carried only an expiry, and renew and
release named no lease: the server could match them only by session. Claude
Code runs Bash tool calls in parallel, so one session can run two
`agentctl lock -- …` at once. Both would get `Held`, and when the first
command exited its `Release` would free the lock while the second command
was still writing to `shared/`.

**Solution.** A new `LeaseId` (a UUID newtype like the other ids) is minted
on every acquire and returned in `LockResponse::Held { lease, expires_at }`.
`LockRequest` is now an enum tagged by `op`, with `Renew { lease }` and
`Release { lease }`, so a renew or release without a lease fails to
deserialize. The lock is exclusive per lease, not per session: a second
acquire, from any session, gets `Busy`, and a renew or release naming any
lease but the current one answers `Released` and changes nothing. T15's
`scope_locks` table takes `lease_id` as its primary key next to
`holder_session`, and its acceptance tests the same-session case.

### Scope keys are not file or Docker names

**Issue.** `ScopeKey`'s rustdoc called its string "safe as one path
segment" because it never contains `/`. It always contains `:`, and may
contain `%` and any other character a platform id holds. A `:` splits a
bollard `binds` entry (`src:dst:ro`), and Docker volume names allow only
`[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*`, so a sandbox that named a directory or a
Docker volume after the key would break or be refused.

**Solution.** The rustdoc of `ScopeKey` and `VolumeKey` now says the string
is a key for columns, labels and logs, not a file or Docker object name. T17
in the plan fixes how volumes are named and mounted: host directories at
`volumes/<agent id>/<lowercase hex SHA-256 of the scope key>` in the agentd
data directory, mounted through bollard's `Mounts` API (`HostConfig::mounts`,
type `bind`), never `binds` strings or named Docker volumes. A digest was
chosen over a reversible encoding of the key (hex or base32), which grows
with the key and could pass the 255-byte file-name limit for a long
Rocket.Chat team id; the `volumes` table records which key a directory holds.

### A Slack bot message may name no user

**Issue.** `InboundEvent::sender` is a required `MemberKey`, but a Slack bot
message may carry only a `bot_id` and no `user`, and the router's
managed-bot lookup (T22) needs one key to look up. The plan did not say what
`sender.user` holds then, or whether the router keys on `sender` or on
`sender_bot_user`.

**Solution.** The router keys on `sender` when `sender_is_bot` is true, and a
surface puts the bot's user id in both `sender.user` and `sender_bot_user`,
so they never disagree: `u._id` on Rocket.Chat, and on Slack the event's
`user`, or the `user_id` from `bots.info` (T29) when the event has only a
`bot_id`. A bot with no known user id keeps its `bot_id` in `sender.user` and
has `sender_bot_user: None`; no binding has that id, so the router ignores
it as an unmanaged bot. `InboundEvent`'s rustdoc has a "Bot senders"
section saying this, and T12, T22, T28 and T29 in the plan match it.

## T04: testkit

### `fake_claude_path` built outside `cargo llvm-cov`'s target directory

**Issue.** The plan expected a nested `$CARGO build` to respect "whatever
target directory is in effect, including `cargo llvm-cov`'s". It doesn't.
`cargo llvm-cov` passes `--target-dir target/llvm-cov-target` on cargo's
command line, and a test process sees only the environment, which does carry
`cargo llvm-cov`'s `RUSTC_WRAPPER`. The nested build therefore went to
`target/debug`, instrumented, where no coverage report looks and where it
disturbs the next plain build. `fake-claude.rs` showed 3.7% line coverage and
pulled the workspace under the 85% gate.

**Solution.** `fake_claude_path()` finds the directory the running test
executable was built in (its nearest ancestor with cargo's `CACHEDIR.TAG`)
and passes it as `--target-dir`. With the inherited wrapper environment the
nested build then matches the outer one: a workspace run reuses the binary
it already built, and a run that didn't build it builds it instrumented in
the same place. `fake-claude.rs` is now at 96% line coverage. The plan's
Testing section says so.

### Clearing the environment loses `fake-claude`'s coverage

**Issue.** Under `cargo llvm-cov`, `fake-claude` is instrumented and writes
its profile where `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` says. A test that starts it with
`env_clear()`, as a runner passing an explicit launch environment would,
drops that variable: the counts are lost and `default.profraw` lands in the
child's working directory.

**Solution.** testkit's own tests pass `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` through when it is
set, and `fake_claude_path()`'s rustdoc tells other crates to do the same
(T17's `ProcessSandbox`, T20, T21).

### The real CLI prefers `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

**Issue.** T04 said `fake-claude` sends `Authorization: Bearer` from
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, and `x-api-key` only when the API key is the only
credential. Against a local capture server, Claude Code 2.1.285 with both
variables set sent only `x-api-key` and reported `apiKeySource:
"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"`.

**Solution.** `fake-claude` does the same, and its `init` line reports
`apiKeySource` like the real one. The T04 bullet and the plan's Claude Code
CLI section say so, and note that the runner sets exactly one of the two.

### What capturing the fixtures showed

**Issue.** Capturing with an unreachable `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, as the plan
describes, gave ten `system/api_retry` lines and no result within two
minutes: the CLI retries with backoff. It also left open how the CLI behaves
on the paths `fake-claude` imitates.

**Solution.** The captures set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_RETRIES=0` (and `IS_SANDBOX=1`,
since the capture ran as root and `bypassPermissions` refuses root otherwise).
Two captures ran against a local server that answers with the same SSE
stream as `fake_anthropic()`, which the CLI accepted, with `--session-id`
and then `--resume`. `fake-claude` follows what they showed:

- `system/init` starts every turn, not only the process. The plan's Claude
  Code CLI section now says so.
- The transcript appears with the first user message, not at start. A
  process reaped before its first turn leaves nothing to `--resume`, so T21
  should mark a session started only after a turn.
- `--session-id` with an existing transcript prints `Error: Session ID … is
  already in use.` to stderr and exits 1. `--resume` without one prints `No
  conversation found with session ID: …` and a `result` line with `subtype:
  "error_during_execution"` and an `errors` list, but no `result`,
  `terminal_reason` or `api_error_status`, then exits 1. Unknown flags and
  both session flags also exit 1 on the real CLI; `fake-claude` keeps the
  plan's status 2 for them so tests can tell usage errors apart.
- Requests go to `/v1/messages?beta=true`, so T18's proxy must forward the
  query string. The CLI also sends `HEAD /api/hello` before the first
  request of each process, and an `x-claude-code-session-id` header.
- A 401 gives `api_error_status: 401` and a synthetic assistant message with
  `error: "authentication_failed"`. The CLI exits 1 when its last result was
  an error and 0 otherwise.
- `rate_limit_event` lines appear after a streamed reply. The
  `active_goal`, `autocompact_state` and `system/commands_changed` lines the
  plan lists didn't appear in these short runs; the fixtures hold only what
  was captured.

Absolute paths in the captures are rewritten to the sandbox layout
(`/volume/sessions/<id>/work` and `…/claude`).

### `rate_limit_event` comes once per process, and only with OAuth

**Issue.** Review asked for `fake-claude` to print a `rate_limit_event`
after every successful API call, so runner tests always meet a line they
must skip. The capture in `tool-turns.jsonl` has one such line for three
API calls, and the CLI's own schema describes the line as "emitted when rate
limit info changes". Re-running Claude Code 2.1.285 against a local
streaming server showed that with `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` it prints one
right after the first `assistant` line of each process, a `--resume`d
process included, and with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` it prints none.

**Solution.** `fake-claude` does the same: with the OAuth token, the first
successful turn of each process prints `{"type":"rate_limit_event",
"rate_limit_info":{"status":"allowed","isUsingOverage":false},…}` after its
first `assistant` line. A test checks a tool turn and a reply against the
capture's line sequence. For anything else a parser must skip, including
lines that aren't JSON, a script turn lists raw `extra_lines`, printed after
its commands and before its reply.

### The real CLI's `anthropic-beta` header

**Issue.** `fake-claude` sent `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` with the
OAuth token and nothing with an API key. The same capture showed Claude Code
2.1.285 sending a comma list with either credential: ten betas with the
OAuth token, starting `claude-code-20250219,oauth-2025-04-20,…`, and nine
with an API key, without `oauth-2025-04-20` and
`extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11` but with
`mid-conversation-tool-changes-2026-07-01`. It also sends `x-app: cli`.

**Solution.** `fake-claude` sends the captured lists, exported as
`testkit::claude::OAUTH_BETA` and `API_KEY_BETA` so T18 can check the proxy
forwards them untouched, and `x-app: cli`. `fake_anthropic()` still records
every header.

### `MockSurface` lost an event when its loop ended mid-delivery

**Issue.** The `events` loop took each event off its channel and then sent
it. When the receiver was gone, or the loop was cancelled while the send
waited for room, that event was dropped, although the docs promise that
queued events stay for the next loop. The mock also ignored its own `Caps`
and could not fail, so tests could not drive the core's handling of
`Unsupported`, `RateLimited` or `Unauthorized`.

**Solution.** Each binding's events are a queue under the mock's lock,
with a `Notify` for new events. The loop sends a copy of the front event and
removes it only once the sender has taken it, so neither a closed receiver
nor a cancellation loses it. Calls check the `Caps` first (`edit` without
`supports_edit`, a thread root without `supports_threads`), then a
per-operation queue filled by `fail_next(op, error)`. Failed calls are not
recorded, as a failed upload already wasn't.

### A refused port the test keeps

**Issue.** The unreachable-upstream test bound a port, dropped the
listener and used the port. A server started by a parallel test could take
the port in between, and the request would succeed or hang.

**Solution.** The test binds a `tokio::net::TcpSocket` and never calls
`listen`. The port stays taken for the whole test, so nothing else can get
it, and a connection to a bound socket that isn't listening is refused at
once.

### `fake_claude_path()`'s nested build

**Issue.** Review found the first call blocking the test thread for about
20 seconds on a second dependency build, without `--locked`.

**Solution.** The nested build passes `--locked`, and the rustdoc says the
first call blocks and should come before any timeout. After a workspace
`cargo test`, the nested build finds everything fresh and takes about
0.2 seconds, and under `cargo coverage` the target directory holds a single
build of each dependency. It builds again only when the caller's package selection
resolved testkit's dependencies with other features, which a test process
can't see. A `--profile` flag doesn't change feature resolution: it would
only help under `cargo test --release`, which nothing here runs, so it isn't
passed.

## T05: store

### The key reaches the store through `open`

**Issue.** The plan gives `Store::open(url)` and `Store::open_in_memory()`,
but the store owns encryption, so it needs the master key, and nothing said
how the key gets there.

**Solution.** Both take a `Sealer`: `Store::open(url, sealer)` and
`Store::open_in_memory(sealer)`. agentd builds the `Sealer` with
`Sealer::from_base64(&master_key)` when it loads its configuration (T10), so
a bad key fails at startup rather than at the first login.
`Sealer::generate_key()` writes a key in the form `from_base64` reads, for
`agentd gen-key` and for tests. The key is standard base64 with padding;
surrounding whitespace, such as a trailing newline, is ignored.

### In-memory SQLite needs one connection that never closes

**Issue.** Every connection to a plain `:memory:` database is a separate,
empty database, so a pool sees a different database on each connection.
sqlx's `sqlite::memory:` URL works around that with a shared-cache database
under a unique name, but a shared-cache in-memory database is deleted when
its last connection closes, and the pool closes idle connections after 10
minutes and every connection after 30. Shared cache also swaps
`busy_timeout` for table-level locks, which can fail with `SQLITE_LOCKED`.

**Solution.** `open_in_memory` uses a pool of exactly one connection with no
idle timeout and no maximum lifetime. Concurrent callers queue for it. `open`
routes in-memory URLs (`sqlite::memory:`, or a `mode=memory` parameter) to the
same pool settings, so an agentd test configured with an in-memory URL (T10)
behaves the same way.

### Switching to WAL can't wait on `busy_timeout`

**Issue.** Changing a database into WAL mode needs an exclusive lock that
SQLite's busy handler doesn't wait for (sqlx says so where it declines to
set a journal mode by default). Two connections opening a new file at once
could fail.

**Solution.** `open` sets `journal_mode=WAL` on every connection, but the
pool opens one connection first and runs the migrations on it before
returning, so the switch happens before any concurrency. WAL mode is stored
in the file, and later connections find it already set. A test checks
`journal_mode`, `foreign_keys` and `busy_timeout` on a file database.

### A deferred transaction can't upgrade to a write under contention

**Issue.** In WAL mode, a transaction that reads and then writes fails at
once with `SQLITE_BUSY` if another connection committed in between;
`busy_timeout` doesn't retry it, because the read snapshot is already stale.
sqlx's `begin()` starts such a deferred transaction.

**Solution.** Writes that must be atomic use a single statement or
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, which takes the write lock up front and does wait on
`busy_timeout`. `take_pending_login` is one `DELETE … RETURNING`. With a
separate `SELECT` and `DELETE`, the concurrent test (eight callers, twenty
rounds, file database) failed in each of three runs. `ensure_member` checks
for the identity, and if it's missing takes
`pool.begin_with("BEGIN IMMEDIATE")`, checks again and inserts, so concurrent
calls for one identity create one member. Later tasks with read-then-write transactions (T15's scope locks,
T21's sessions) should do the same.

### Timestamps are Unix seconds and IDs are text

**Issue.** sqlx encodes `OffsetDateTime` as RFC 3339 text in the value's own
offset, writing fractional seconds only when they are non-zero. SQLite
compares that text byte by byte, so `expires_at <= ?` is wrong across
offsets, and even in UTC `…:00Z` sorts after `…:00.5Z`. sqlx encodes `Uuid`
as a 16-byte blob, which is unreadable in the `sqlite3` shell and doesn't
match the canonical text form core-types uses in keys.

**Solution.** Timestamps are `INTEGER` Unix seconds (sub-second precision is
dropped), and IDs are `TEXT` in core-types' lowercase hyphenated form, bound
with `to_string()` and parsed back with `FromStr`. A value that doesn't parse
is `StoreError::Corrupt`. Tables are `STRICT`, so a mistyped bind fails
instead of being stored. The foundation migration's header lists these
conventions for later migrations.

### `sqlx::migrate!` doesn't notice new migrations

**Issue.** `sqlx::migrate!` embeds `migrations/` at compile time, but on
stable Rust it can't ask Cargo to watch the directory. Adding a migration
without touching Rust code leaves a stale build that doesn't apply it.

**Solution.** `crates/store/build.rs` prints
`cargo:rerun-if-changed=migrations`. sqlx also checksums applied migrations,
so a migration must never be edited once merged; add a new one instead.

### sqlx 0.9.0 brings older copies of six crates

**Issue.** With sqlx in the lockfile, cargo-deny warned about duplicate
versions: sqlx-core 0.9.0, the latest release, depends on `base64` 0.22,
`sha2` 0.10 (so `block-buffer` 0.10, `cpufeatures` 0.2 and `crypto-common`
0.1), `hashlink` 0.11 (so `hashbrown` 0.16) and `syn` 2, while the workspace
uses the newer ones (`base64` 0.23, chacha20poly1305's RustCrypto 0.2/0.3
crates, `syn` 3).

**Solution.** `deny.toml` skips exactly those versions, each with the reason,
so a new duplicate of the same crates still warns. No license changed.

### The store needs no `rand`

**Issue.** The plan lists `rand` for crypto. chacha20poly1305 0.11 (aead
0.6) generates nonces and keys itself through its default `getrandom`
feature (`Nonce::try_generate()`), returning an error instead of panicking
if the OS generator fails.

**Solution.** `store` doesn't depend on `rand`. It enables chacha20poly1305's
`zeroize` feature, so the cipher wipes its key on drop, and decrypts into a
buffer that is wiped after the `SecretString` is built.

### The `members` table lists the surfaces

**Issue.** The foundation migration declares `members.surface` with
`CHECK (surface IN ('slack', 'rocketchat'))`, which couples `SurfaceKind` in
core-types to the schema.

**Solution.** Kept, so the store refuses a surface it has never heard of.
A task that adds a `SurfaceKind` variant must also add a migration that
relaxes the constraint; until it does, `ensure_member` fails at runtime for
the new surface.

## T06: Slack mrkdwn

### Escaping applies inside code too

**Issue.** T06 said to escape `&`, `<` and `>` "outside code", while its
acceptance criterion says code must come out "untouched except for escaping".
Slack reads its control sequences (`<!here>`, `<@U…>`, `<url|label>`) before
it applies any formatting, so an unescaped `<!here>` inside a code block still
notifies the channel. qm-core leaves code verbatim and has that hole.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` escapes the three characters everywhere, code
included, and changes nothing else inside code: no mention resolution, no
broadcast neutralization, no formatting. Slack shows `&lt;` as `<` inside code,
so the reader sees the original text. The T06 bullet in the plan now says
"everywhere".

### Literal Slack tokens are escaped, not passed through

**Issue.** qm-core passes literal wire tokens in model output through
unchanged (`<@U123>`, `<!subteam^S1>`, `<!date^…>`, `<https://x.io|label>`),
and only rewrites `<!here>`, `<!channel>` and `<!everyone>`. That lets model
output ping a whole user group, and it conflicts with escaping `<`.

**Solution.** The agent writes standard Markdown, and mentions go through the
`MentionDirectory`, as the design says. So every literal `<` is escaped, and
the tokens show as text. The broadcast forms still become qm-core's
`@\u{200B}here` text rather than escaped brackets, since the plan asks for
that. CommonMark parses `<https://x.io|label>` as an autolink whose URL
contains `|`; link URLs percent-encode `|` (and spaces), so it becomes
`<https://x.io%7Clabel>`. A link destination starting with `!`, `@` or `#` is
percent-encoded too, because `[x](<!here>)` would otherwise render as the
broadcast `<!here|x>`.

### Typed broadcasts get a zero-width space

**Issue.** qm-core leaves typed `@here`, `@channel` and `@everyone` alone. They
are inert only because qm-core posts without Slack's `link_names` flag.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` inserts U+200B after the `@` (outside code, ignoring
case, not after a letter or digit, so `me@here.com` is untouched), which
matches what the wire forms become. These names are never offered to the
directory, so a member called "here" can't be pinged through them.

This does not make the output safe under every posting flag. With
`link_names=1` (or `parse=full`) Slack would still link an unresolved `@devs`
that stays text, and ping that user group, and code keeps a typed `@here`
as written. Rewriting every unresolved `@word` would mangle ordinary text, so
the renderer relies on the Slack surface never setting either flag. T29's
deliverables and acceptance in the plan now say so.

### Bare URLs get explicit bounds

**Issue.** T06 said bare URLs are "left alone". qm-core wraps them in `<…>`
because Slack's own URL detection pulled neighboring mrkdwn marks into the
link: `*https://x.io/#/device*` linked to `…/device*` (qm-core's
"device-code bug"). The Markdown parser strips the `**`, but the output puts
Slack's `*` right back next to the URL.

**Solution.** Bare `http://` and `https://` URLs in text become `<url>`, with
trailing punctuation and unmatched closing brackets left outside, as qm-core's
`trimUrlTail` does. Link labels and code are not scanned. `www.` addresses are
still left to Slack. The T06 bullet in the plan now says so.

### Emphasis inside a bare URL cut the link

**Issue.** CommonMark reads `_…_`, `__…__`, `*…*` and `~~…~~` inside a URL's
path as emphasis, so pulldown-cmark splits the URL's text around it, and a
scan of one text node linked only the part before:
`see https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html` became
`see <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>*main*.html`. qm-core's regex pass
kept such URLs whole.

**Solution.** Before building the tree, the renderer measures bare URLs in
the source over each run of text and emphasis events. A run ends where the
rendered text stops being a URL: at a character reference or escape that
renders as a space, `<`, `>` or `|` (`&lt;`), and at anything other than
text and emphasis, such as inline code. Each run is scanned once, so the
pass stays linear; measuring from every text node to the next source
terminator instead took 19 s on ``"`c`https://a"`` repeated 10,000 times,
since each cut made the next URL scan the rest of the run again. Emphasis
or strikethrough whose opening delimiter is inside such a range is replaced
by its children, with its delimiters as text, so the URL is one text run
again and is linked whole. A URL right after a character reference or
escape that renders as a letter or digit isn't measured, as `&#97;` before
`https://` makes it part of a word, which neither Slack nor the renderer
links; its emphasis still formats.
Markup that opens before a URL wraps it and is not touched, even when the
source runs on past its closing delimiter: `**https://x.io/a**'s` stays bold,
as `*<https://x.io/a>*'s`.

qm-core's `trimUrlTail` also drops a trailing `*`, `_` or `~`, since its
regexes could hand formatting marks to the URL scan. Here that cut a URL the
pass had kept whole: `…/datamodel.html#object.__init__` was linked as
`<…#object.__init>__`, landing on the wrong anchor. Keeping every trailing
mark was wrong too: a mark left in a text node is literal, but it can be a
footnote star, an escaped mark or a stray closer as easily as part of the
path, and since the trim stops at the first character it keeps, a kept star
also shielded the `)` or `.` before it, so `(https://x.io/pricing).*` was
linked as `<https://x.io/pricing).*>`. The trim now keeps a trailing run of
one mark only when it follows an alphanumeric character (Unicode's) and the
same mark appears earlier in the URL after the scheme (`#object.__init__`,
`/_a_`, `/~~a~~`, and `/_a_` in `https://x.io/_a_)`). Otherwise the run is
dropped and trimming goes on, so a mark after punctuation or a closing
bracket, as in `(https://x.io/_a)_` or `https://x.io/my*page.*`, never
shields the characters before it. The trim sees decoded text, so the Slack
renderer, which knows the offsets of the marks the source escaped (`\_`,
`&#95;`, `&lowbar;`), ends a URL before the first escaped mark in that
trailing run: `https://x.io/my_page\_` keeps its `_` out of the link, while
an escaped mark inside the path, as in `https://x.io/a\_b`, stays part of
it. A URL that is only a scheme and marks, such as `https://_`, is left as
text. Dropping the run only after punctuation or an unmatched closer was
tried too: on a corpus of generated inputs it linked past the original trim
in about three times as many inputs, and still linked `https://x.io/a.*__*`
whole.

### CommonMark disagrees with some qm-core regex cases

**Issue.** qm-core converts with regexes; this renderer walks the
`pulldown-cmark` tree, which follows CommonMark:

- `above\n---\nbelow` is a setext heading, not a rule.
- An unclosed fence runs to the end of the document instead of staying
  verbatim.
- A ```` ``` ```` run in the middle of a line is a code span, not a fence.
- Block spacing isn't in the event stream.

**Solution.** Follow the parse tree, and adapt the ported test cases, which
name each difference. Blocks are separated by a blank line when the source had
one between them (compared by source line numbers), and by a line break
otherwise, so `### Deep\nbody` still gives `*Deep*\nbody`. Fenced blocks keep
their info string, as qm-core and T07's fence reopening assume, even though
Slack doesn't highlight syntax. A code body that itself holds ```` ``` ````
still gets a backtick fence (see
[Backtick runs close a Slack code block](#backtick-runs-close-a-slack-code-block)).

### Unbounded nesting overflows the stack

**Issue.** `pulldown-cmark` emits a flat event stream, but any tree walk over
it recurses once per nesting level, and so does dropping the tree. A line of
100,000 `>` (or `*`) aborted the process with a stack overflow.

**Solution.** The tree builder keeps at most 64 levels (`MAX_DEPTH`). Elements
nested deeper are flattened into their ancestor at the limit: their text
stays, their markup is dropped. A test renders 100,000 levels on a test
thread's default stack.

### `@Name` grammar details

**Issue.** qm-core's `PLAIN_MENTION` regex relies on backtracking. When the
greedy one-to-three-word name runs into `/` or `@`, the regex retries shorter
matches, down to part of a word (`@ankit/x` tries `anki`). When nothing
resolves, it skips the whole matched run, so `@nobody https://x.io` never
wraps the URL.

**Solution.** `render::mention::scan` takes the greedy words, drops the last
word when it runs into `/` or `@` (a lone word then isn't a mention), and tries
the longest name first, as qm-core does, including its rule that a capitalized
next word means somebody else (`@Ankit Torres` stays text when only "Ankit" is
known). An unresolved name consumes only its first word, so the rest of the
line is still scanned. Names are passed to the directory as written;
`MentionDirectory` implementations own case folding. The scanner lives in
`render::mention` so T07's Rocket.Chat renderer can reuse it with its own
broadcast names.

### A link label can disguise its destination

**Issue.** `[https://good.com](https://evil.com)` became
`<https://evil.com|https://good.com>`: Slack shows `https://good.com` and
opens `evil.com`. Model output is untrusted (a prompt injection can write the
link), so a label must not be able to name a different site than the link.

**Solution.** Before writing `<url|label>`, the renderer takes the label as
plain text and looks at each word. A word with a `scheme://` or `mailto:`
prefix, or one shaped like a domain name (two or more dot-separated labels of
letters, digits and `-` ending in an alphabetic or `xn--` label, including
`user@host` addresses) or an IPv4 address, names a host. The authority ends at
`/`, `?`, `#` or `\`, as in browsers, and the host is what follows its last
`@`. Hosts are compared after dropping the port and a trailing dot, dropping
default-ignorable characters (zero-width spaces, soft hyphens, bidirectional
controls: they render as nothing and could hide a dot from the check), mapping
dot look-alikes (`。`, `．`, `｡`, `﹒`, `․`) to `.`, lowercasing, and dropping
a leading `www.`. When any named host differs from the URL's, the label is
written as text next to a bare link, `https://good.com (<https://evil.com>)`,
the same shape table cells already use. The label's text stays unarmed, as in
a link; if Slack links a URL in it on its own, that link shows its own
destination, so nothing needs neutralizing. Images get the same check on their
alt text. Autolinks have no separate label, and email autolinks pass because
the address and the `mailto:` URL name the same host.

The check errs toward showing the URL. There is no IDNA mapping, so a Unicode
label and its punycode URL (`bücher.de`, `https://xn--bcher-kva.de`) count as
different, and so do a domain and its subdomains. File names whose extension
is also a top-level domain (`main.rs`, `README.md`) look like domains, so
`[main.rs](https://github.com/…)` becomes `main.rs (<https://github.com/…>)`.
A homoglyph URL (`https://аpple.com` with a Cyrillic `а`) is still shown as
written; the check only stops a label from vouching for it.

### Slack doesn't format inside a word

**Issue.** CommonMark lets `*` emphasis start or end inside a word, so `5*3*2`
and `a*b*c` parse as emphasis. Rendering it as `_3_` gave `5_3_2`, which Slack
doesn't format either, since it only formats at word boundaries: the reader saw
underscores where the agent wrote asterisks. qm-core's regex leaves both
alone.

**Solution.** Emphasis, strong emphasis and strikethrough directly preceded or
followed by a letter or digit in the source keep their Markdown delimiter
character, once on each side, and their contents render without that style:
`5*3*2` → `5*3*2`, and `foo**bar**baz` → `foo*bar*baz`, which is also what
qm-core produces. Doubling the delimiter back to `**` would leave an inner
`*bar*` pair that Slack could format. `_` can't open or close emphasis inside
a word in CommonMark, so `snake_case_name` was already text.

### Backslash escapes have no Slack equivalent

**Issue.** `\*not bold\*` parses as the literal text `*not bold*`, and
Slack then bolds it; the same goes for `_`, `~` and `` ` ``, and for character
references such as `&ast;`. Slack's mrkdwn has no escape character.

**Solution.** pulldown-cmark starts a new text event at each escaped
character, so the tree builder records the offset of any text event that
begins with one of `*`, `_`, `~` or `` ` `` and either follows a backslash or
differs from its source (a character reference). Outside code those
characters get U+200B on both sides, which keeps them from opening or closing
Slack formatting if Slack treats U+200B as a word character or as a space.
(If it treated it as punctuation, no invisible character could help.) A
character with a letter or digit on both sides is left alone, because
Slack wouldn't format there and the zero-width space could act as a boundary
that lets it. Image alt text is plain text, so every such character in it is
treated as escaped. Table cells render inside a code block and need nothing.
A literal `*` right after an escaped backslash (`\\* x`) counts as escaped
too, which only adds zero-width spaces. Slack's exact boundary rules aren't
documented, so T29's live check should confirm this renders as intended.

### Backtick runs close a Slack code block

**Issue.** A code body holding ```` ``` ```` used to get a `~~~` fence, as in
qm-core. Slack doesn't know tilde fences, so the whole block rendered as
mrkdwn and the inner ```` ``` ```` opened a real code block.

**Solution.** Code blocks and tables always use a backtick fence. Slack closes
a code block at any run of three backticks and has no escape, so a U+200B goes
before every third backtick in a row inside the block, and before a backtick
that starts the info string. The block shows the same characters, but copying
it out carries the zero-width spaces along.

### A link with an empty URL

**Issue.** `[x]()` rendered as `<|x>`, which Slack doesn't parse as a link.

**Solution.** A link or image whose URL is empty shows only its label (`x`),
and nothing when the label is empty too. Table cells show just the label as
well, instead of `x ()`.

### Wire broadcast labels are searched a bounded distance

**Issue.** Each `<!here|` looked for its closing `>` to the end of the text,
so a message of many `<!here|` without `>` took quadratic time: 210 KB took
0.2 s.

**Solution.** The `>` must come within 256 bytes (`MAX_WIRE_LABEL`) and before
a line break. A longer or unclosed token stays escaped text (`&lt;!here|…`),
which is just as harmless. A test renders 2.1 MB of unclosed `<!here|` under a
time limit that the quadratic version exceeds several times over.

### Code spans holding backticks

**Issue.** Slack ends inline code at the next backtick and has no escape, so
a code span that holds one (``` `` a`b `` ```) renders as `` `a`b` ``, and
Slack shows `a` as code followed by a stray `` b` ``. qm-core has the same
limit.

**Solution.** Left as is. A zero-width space doesn't stop a backtick from
closing inline code, and replacing the backtick with a look-alike would change
the code's text. Agents rarely put backticks in inline code; a fenced block
shows them correctly.

## T07: splitting and directives

### Split the rendered text, not the Markdown

**Issue.** T07 didn't say whether `split` runs on the agent's Markdown or on
a renderer's output. Rendering changes the length (`&` becomes `&amp;`, a link
becomes `<url|label>`, a table grows padding), so chunks cut from Markdown
can exceed the limit once rendered. And the renderers need whole constructs:
a table or a list cut in two renders differently.

**Solution.** The order is extract directives, render, then split, as T23's
delivery steps already list. `split` knows both renderers' output syntax:
it never cuts inside a Slack `<…>` token, an HTML entity such as `&amp;`, a
Markdown link or image, an `@mention`, a fence line, or a character, and
keeps grapheme clusters together (see [Grapheme clusters need a mark
table](#grapheme-clusters-need-a-mark-table)). A property test renders
generated Markdown with `to_mrkdwn` and checks that no cut lands inside a
token or an entity. The crate docs state the order.

### Chunks keep their whitespace, so they rejoin exactly

**Issue.** The acceptance property says that rejoining the chunks with the
fences removed gives the original text. Trimming the whitespace at a cut
would break that.

**Solution.** Chunks are consecutive slices of the text, plus the fence lines
the splitter adds. A cut falls after a blank line, a line break or a run of
spaces, and that whitespace stays at the end of the earlier chunk, so the next
chunk doesn't start with a blank line. The tests check the property on the
splitter's internal pieces, and check separately that each piece renders as
reopening line, slice and closing fence.

### Where the splitter cuts

**Issue.** qm-core's `safeCutIndex` backs off from the limit to avoid a `<…>`
token or an unbalanced `` ` ``, `*` or `~`, but it doesn't look for paragraph,
line or word breaks, and it counts ```` ``` ```` anywhere in the text as a
fence.

**Solution.** A break is used when it falls in the second half of the chunk:
a blank line outside code, or the start or end of a code block, first, then a
line break, then a space outside code. Spaces inside a code block don't
count, since a cut there breaks a code line in two. Otherwise the latest break
of any kind wins, and a word is cut only as a last resort. Code spans and
pairs of `*`, `_` or `~` on a line are kept whole only if that still leaves
at least a quarter of the chunk, like qm-core's 25% floor, because an `_` in
an identifier can pair with one much further along the line. The hard rules
above give way only when one construct is longer than a chunk. Fences are
found line by line: three or more backticks or tildes after optional spaces
and `>` markers, and a closing line needs the same number of `>`, so a
blockquoted fence in Slack output (`> ```sh`) is closed and reopened with its
prefix. A cut never lands just after an opening line or just before a closing
line, which would leave an empty code block.

### Limits smaller than a fence or a character

**Issue.** A continuation chunk repeats the opening fence line and adds a
closing one. With a tiny limit, or a very long info string, those lines alone
leave no room for content, and a limit of 1 UTF-16 unit can't hold an emoji at
all. qm-core stops repeating fences below a 32-character budget.

**Solution.** A fence is repeated only when twice its opening line plus four
units fits the limit, which guarantees that every chunk can hold at least one
character between them. Otherwise the block is split like plain text. A chunk
always holds at least one character, so a limit below one character's size is
exceeded rather than looping; the rustdoc says so. Real limits (3,000 and
5,000) never get near either case.

### Rocket.Chat mentions need a username, not an id

**Issue.** `MentionDirectory::resolve` was documented as returning a platform
user id, which is what Slack's `<@U…>` needs. Rocket.Chat mentions are written
`@username`; a user id there is not a mention.

**Solution.** The trait now returns "the handle the surface's mention syntax
needs": a user id on Slack, a username on Rocket.Chat. The Rocket.Chat
renderer only accepts a username made of ASCII letters and digits, `.`, `_`
and `-` (the server's name pattern) that isn't a broadcast name, so a
directory entry can't turn a mention into a broadcast. Name resolution
leaves code spans, code blocks, link destinations, autolinks and bare URLs
alone, found with the same `pulldown-cmark` parse (`render::verbatim`).
Broadcasts are neutralized everywhere, code and URLs included (see [Code
doesn't protect a broadcast on
Rocket.Chat](#code-doesnt-protect-a-broadcast-on-rocketchat)). The bare URL
scanner moved from `slack.rs` to `render::url` to be shared.

The shared trim keeps a trailing run of `*`, `_` or `~` only when it
follows a letter or digit and the URL holds the same mark earlier, for both
surfaces (see
[Emphasis inside a bare URL cut the link](#emphasis-inside-a-bare-url-cut-the-link)).
On Rocket.Chat the URL only bounds the text name resolution skips: the
renderer copies the source through either way, and what the trim drops is
never an `@`, so how it treats those marks changes no output there. What
the server's own Markdown makes of `…#object.__init__` depends on the text
it receives, which is the same either way, so Rocket.Chat has no reason for
a trim of its own. A Rocket.Chat test pins that such a URL passes through
whole, with a name after it resolved and a name inside it left alone.

### Code doesn't protect a broadcast on Rocket.Chat

**Issue.** The renderer first neutralized `@all` and `@here` only outside
code and link targets, with the Slack renderer's word rules (Unicode letters
and digits, not after a letter). Rocket.Chat decides who a message notifies
from its raw text, not from rendered Markdown. `MentionsParser.getUserMentions`
(`app/mentions/lib/MentionsParser.ts`, the same in 7.10.0 and 8.0.0) removes
`[label](dest)` links with `/\[[^\]]*\]\([^)]+\)/g`, then matches
`(^|\s|>)@([0-9a-zA-Z-_.]+…)` with flags `gm`, and
`MentionsServer.getUsersByMentions` (`app/mentions/server/Mentions.ts`)
notifies the room when the name is `all` or `here`. The name class is
ASCII-only and code isn't special. So `@all` in a fenced, indented or inline
code span, `@allé` and `@here٣` (the name ends at the first non-ASCII
character), a link title spanning lines, inline HTML (`<a>@all</a>`),
`[x](y)@all` at a line start (the link removal leaves `@all` there), and a
directory entry resolving to `allé` all broadcast.

**Solution.** After rendering, `to_markdown` makes one last pass over the
whole output, code and link targets included, with the server's grammar: it
inserts U+200B after every `@` whose following run of `[0-9A-Za-z._-]` is
`all` or `here`, ignoring case and trailing `.`, `_` and `-`, unless a `/`
precedes the `@`. The server reads no name after the zero-width space, and
it never reads one after `/`, which is not in `(^|\s|>)`; link removal can't
put anything else before such an `@` either, since a removed link ends in
`)`. So `https://x.io/@all` stays a working link, while a code sample
containing ` @here` still gets the zero-width space, because the server
doesn't know about code. `split` never cuts just before an `@` that follows
anything but whitespace or `>`, even when a construct longer than a chunk
forces a cut, so a chunk can't start with the `@all` of such a URL. `@allison` and
`@all.hands` stay untouched. The pass is the only place that inserts the
space; name resolution just skips broadcasts so they are never offered to
the directory. Usernames from the directory must match the server's ASCII
class. The tests port the server's regex (`rocketchat::server`, checked
against the JavaScript regex under Node on 30,000 generated strings while
writing it) and assert that no output, and no chunk `split` makes from it,
yields `all` or `here`. The rule assumes the default
`UTF8_User_Names_Validation` pattern; a server configured with a narrower
name pattern could read `@all` out of `@all.hands`.

### A cut can create or shorten a mention

**Issue.** A mention was kept whole only when its `@` followed a
non-alphanumeric character, and a cut could fall right before any `@`. The
server's grammar accepts an `@` at the start of the message, so a harmless
`x@name` could become a mention at the start of the next chunk, and a forced
cut inside an oversized construct could shorten `@herectic` to `@here`.

**Solution.** `split` keeps every `@` and the name after it together,
whatever precedes the `@`, and never cuts right before an `@` that follows
anything but whitespace or `>`. When a single construct is longer than the
chunk and a cut has to fall inside it, the cut still avoids the inside of a
name and the position just before an `@` that follows anything but
whitespace or `>`: it falls right after the `@` instead, so neither chunk
holds a shortened name or starts with a new one. This holds inside a
`<…>` token and after an unclosed `<` as well: the token scan first jumped
past them without looking at their `@`s, so a forced cut in `<aaaaaaaa/@all`
gave a chunk `@all`. Together with the final pass above, every `@` run in a chunk is a run of the rendered text, and
those are already neutralized or follow a `/`, where the server reads no
mention.

### Grapheme clusters need a mark table

**Issue.** The splitter's list of characters that attach to the one before
them covered combining diacritics, variation selectors, emoji modifiers,
the joiner and tags, but no script-specific marks. `"कि"` repeated and split
at 1,001 characters gave chunks starting with the vowel sign U+093F; Thai
vowels and tone marks, Hebrew and Arabic points, and Hangul vowel and
trailing jamo were cut the same way. The workspace has no Unicode property
crate.

**Solution.** `split::graphemes` holds a table of 336 ranges: every
character of general category `Mn`, `Mc` or `Me`, plus everything Unicode 17
gives `Grapheme_Cluster_Break` `Extend`, `SpacingMark`, `V`, `T` or `ZWJ`,
generated from the `unicode-segmentation` crate's tables and Python's
`unicodedata`. A cut also never falls after an Indic virama
(`Indic_Conjunct_Break=Linker`) before a letter, after a zero-width joiner,
or after a Hangul leading jamo before another leading jamo or a syllable.
Prepend characters and the full emoji ZWJ grammar are left out; the rules
only ever remove cut positions, so an approximation errs toward longer
clusters.

### Reference links and long entity names

**Issue.** Codex's review found two cuts the splitter allowed: inside a
reference-style link, `aaaa[label][ref]` with `[ref]: /url` below, split at
13, and inside an HTML entity with a name longer than ten characters, such
as `&CounterClockwiseContourIntegral;`.

**Solution.** When the text defines a label (a line starting `[label]:`
after optional spaces and `>` markers), `[text][label]`, `[label][]` and
`[label]` on one line are kept whole like inline links, with labels matched
case-insensitively and with whitespace collapsed, as CommonMark does. Only
labels without brackets and up to 999 characters count, which also keeps
the matching linear. Brackets without a definition are ordinary text. An
entity name may now have up to 31 characters, the length of the longest
HTML5 name.

### Directive details qm-core decides and T07 doesn't

**Issue.** T07 names only `[[react: <emoji>]]`. qm-core's `extractReactions`
also accepts several names per directive, names with colons, literal emoji
characters (through a generated table of about 1,800 entries), and a target
message after `@`, caps a reply at five reactions, strips an unclosed
`[[react:` running to the end of the text, and trims every line of the reply,
code included, whenever it removed something.

**Solution.** `directives::extract` accepts several names separated by spaces
or commas, strips colons, lowercases, keeps only valid short names
(`[a-z0-9_+'-]+` with an optional `::skin-tone-2` to `-6`, at most
`MAX_NAME_LEN`, 64, characters in all), drops duplicates and returns at most
`MAX_REACTIONS` (5). Literal emoji characters are dropped:
the table would be a large data file for a case the agent's instructions can
avoid. A directive with an `@` target is removed without effect, since
reacting to the current message instead would be wrong and short message ids
belong to T23's `message_refs`. An unclosed `[[react:` is removed only on the
last line, so prose that mentions the syntax can't delete the rest of a
reply. Whitespace is cleaned only next to removed directives: a line that
held only directives goes, space before a directive at the end of a line
goes, and at most one blank line is left where a line was removed. Code is
found with the parse tree, and a directive overlapping it is left as text.
