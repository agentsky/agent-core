# Implementation notes

Unexpected issues met while implementing [`tasks-plan.md`](tasks-plan.md), and
how they were solved. Newest entries go at the end of their task's section.
When a note changes a decision in the plan or the design, the same PR updates
that document too.

## T01: workspace skeleton

### reqwest 0.13 defaults to aws-lc-rs, not ring

**Issue.** The plan chose rustls on the `ring` provider. reqwest 0.13 made
`aws-lc-rs` its only built-in rustls provider: its `rustls` feature enables
`aws-lc-rs`, and the provider-free alternative, `rustls-no-provider`, panics
at `Client::new()` unless a provider is installed first (`reqwest`
`src/async_impl/client.rs`, `default_rustls_crypto_provider`). Staying on
`ring` would mean installing it before every client is built, including in
every library crate's tests.

**Solution.** Use reqwest's `rustls` feature, so `aws-lc-rs` is the one
provider in the tree. `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`
resolves to the same provider, and `cargo tree` shows no `ring`, `openssl-sys`
or `native-tls`. A probe build with reqwest, tokio-tungstenite, sqlx (SQLite)
and bollard compiled in 32 seconds on this machine. `aws-lc-sys` needs a C
compiler (and `cmake` on some targets), which the GitHub Ubuntu runners have.

Consequences:

- The workspace declares reqwest with `default-features = false` and only
  `json`. Crates that talk HTTPS add the `rustls` feature. `agentctl` talks
  plain HTTP to `agentctl.internal` and doesn't, so its static musl build
  stays free of C code.
- T02's license policy has to allow the `OpenSSL` license for `aws-lc-sys`
  (its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND OpenSSL`) as a
  per-crate exception.
- The plan's Libraries table and T02 are updated to match.

### cargo-llvm-cov ignores `default-members`

**Issue.** The plan relied on `default-members = [".", "crates/*"]` to make
the existing `cargo coverage` alias cover every crate. `cargo test` honors it,
and every crate's tests ran under coverage, but `cargo llvm-cov` still
reported only the root package's files. The gate would have measured
`src/lib.rs` alone.

**Solution.** Add `--workspace` to the `coverage` alias in
`.cargo/config.toml`, and to the CI step that prints the summary
(`cargo llvm-cov report --workspace --summary-only`). The report now lists
every crate.
