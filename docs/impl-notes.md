# Implementation notes

Unexpected issues met while implementing [`tasks-plan.md`](tasks-plan.md), and
how they were solved. Newest entries go at the end of their task's section.
When a note changes a decision in the plan or the design, the same PR updates
that document too.

## T01: workspace skeleton

### reqwest 0.13 defaults to aws-lc-rs, not ring

**Issue.** The plan chose rustls on the `ring` provider. reqwest 0.13 made
`aws-lc-rs` its only built-in rustls provider: its `rustls` feature enables
`aws-lc-rs`, and the provider-free alternative, `rustls-no-provider`, panics
at `Client::new()` unless a provider is installed first (`reqwest`
`src/async_impl/client.rs`, `default_rustls_crypto_provider`). Staying on
`ring` would mean installing it before every client is built, including in
every library crate's tests.

**Solution.** Use reqwest's `rustls` feature, so `aws-lc-rs` is the one
provider in the tree. `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`
resolves to the same provider, and `cargo tree` shows no `ring`, `openssl-sys`
or `native-tls`. A probe build with reqwest, tokio-tungstenite, sqlx (SQLite)
and bollard compiled in 32 seconds on this machine. `aws-lc-sys` needs a C
compiler (and `cmake` on some targets), which the GitHub Ubuntu runners have.

Consequences:

- The workspace declares reqwest with `default-features = false` and only
  `json`. Crates that talk HTTPS add the `rustls` feature. `agentctl` talks
  plain HTTP to `agentctl.internal` and doesn't, so its static musl build
  stays free of C code.
- T02's license policy has to allow the `OpenSSL` license for `aws-lc-sys`
  (its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND OpenSSL`) as a
  per-crate exception.
- The plan's Libraries table and T02 are updated to match.

### Toolchain

The container's `stable` toolchain was 1.94, older than the workspace's
`rust-version` (1.98.1), so `cargo` refused to build. Run
`rustup default 1.98.1` (or newer) first. CI installs the current stable,
which is newer.

### cargo-llvm-cov ignores `default-members`

**Issue.** The plan relied on `default-members = [".", "crates/*"]` to make
the existing `cargo coverage` alias cover every crate. `cargo test` honors it,
and every crate's tests ran under coverage, but `cargo llvm-cov` still
reported only the root package's files. The gate would have measured
`src/lib.rs` alone.

**Solution.** Add `--workspace` to the `coverage` alias in
`.cargo/config.toml`, and to the CI step that prints the summary
(`cargo llvm-cov report --workspace --summary-only`). The report now lists
every crate.

## T06: Slack mrkdwn

### Escaping applies inside code too

**Issue.** T06 said to escape `&`, `<` and `>` "outside code", while its
acceptance criterion says code must come out "untouched except for escaping".
Slack reads its control sequences (`<!here>`, `<@U…>`, `<url|label>`) before
it applies any formatting, so an unescaped `<!here>` inside a code block still
notifies the channel. qm-core leaves code verbatim and has that hole.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` escapes the three characters everywhere, code
included, and changes nothing else inside code: no mention resolution, no
broadcast neutralization, no formatting. Slack shows `&lt;` as `<` inside code,
so the reader sees the original text. The T06 bullet in the plan now says
"everywhere".

### Literal Slack tokens are escaped, not passed through

**Issue.** qm-core passes literal wire tokens in model output through
unchanged (`<@U123>`, `<!subteam^S1>`, `<!date^…>`, `<https://x.io|label>`),
and only rewrites `<!here>`, `<!channel>` and `<!everyone>`. That lets model
output ping a whole user group, and it conflicts with escaping `<`.

**Solution.** The agent writes standard Markdown, and mentions go through the
`MentionDirectory`, as the design says. So every literal `<` is escaped, and
the tokens show as text. The broadcast forms still become qm-core's
`@\u{200B}here` text rather than escaped brackets, since the plan asks for
that. CommonMark parses `<https://x.io|label>` as an autolink whose URL
contains `|`; link URLs percent-encode `|` (and spaces), so it becomes
`<https://x.io%7Clabel>`. A link destination starting with `!`, `@` or `#` is
percent-encoded too, because `[x](<!here>)` would otherwise render as the
broadcast `<!here|x>`.

### Typed broadcasts get a zero-width space

**Issue.** qm-core leaves typed `@here`, `@channel` and `@everyone` alone. They
are inert only because qm-core posts without Slack's `link_names` flag.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` inserts U+200B after the `@` (outside code, ignoring
case, not after a letter or digit, so `me@here.com` is untouched). The output
is harmless whatever flags the Slack surface posts with, and it matches what
the wire forms become. These names are never offered to the directory, so a
member called "here" can't be pinged through them.

### Bare URLs get explicit bounds

**Issue.** T06 said bare URLs are "left alone". qm-core wraps them in `<…>`
because Slack's own URL detection pulled neighboring mrkdwn marks into the
link: `*https://x.io/#/device*` linked to `…/device*` (qm-core's
"device-code bug"). The Markdown parser strips the `**`, but the output puts
Slack's `*` right back next to the URL.

**Solution.** Bare `http://` and `https://` URLs in text become `<url>`, with
trailing punctuation and unmatched closing brackets left outside, as qm-core's
`trimUrlTail` does. Link labels and code are not scanned. `www.` addresses are
still left to Slack. The T06 bullet in the plan now says so.

### CommonMark disagrees with some qm-core regex cases

**Issue.** qm-core converts with regexes; this renderer walks the
`pulldown-cmark` tree, which follows CommonMark:

- `above\n---\nbelow` is a setext heading, not a rule.
- An unclosed fence runs to the end of the document instead of staying
  verbatim.
- A ```` ``` ```` run in the middle of a line is a code span, not a fence.
- Block spacing isn't in the event stream.

**Solution.** Follow the parse tree, and adapt the ported test cases, which
name each difference. Blocks are separated by a blank line when the source had
one between them (compared by source line numbers), and by a line break
otherwise, so `### Deep\nbody` still gives `*Deep*\nbody`. Fenced blocks keep
their info string, as qm-core and T07's fence reopening assume, even though
Slack doesn't highlight syntax. A code body that itself holds ```` ``` ````
keeps a `~~~` fence, like qm-core, because a backtick fence would close early.

### Unbounded nesting overflows the stack

**Issue.** `pulldown-cmark` emits a flat event stream, but any tree walk over
it recurses once per nesting level, and so does dropping the tree. A line of
100,000 `>` (or `*`) aborted the process with a stack overflow.

**Solution.** The tree builder keeps at most 64 levels (`MAX_DEPTH`). Elements
nested deeper are flattened into their ancestor at the limit: their text
stays, their markup is dropped. A test renders 100,000 levels on a test
thread's default stack.

### `@Name` grammar details

**Issue.** qm-core's `PLAIN_MENTION` regex relies on backtracking. When the
greedy one-to-three-word name runs into `/` or `@`, the regex retries shorter
matches, down to part of a word (`@ankit/x` tries `anki`). When nothing
resolves, it skips the whole matched run, so `@nobody https://x.io` never
wraps the URL.

**Solution.** `render::mention::scan` takes the greedy words, drops the last
word when it runs into `/` or `@` (a lone word then isn't a mention), and tries
the longest name first, as qm-core does, including its rule that a capitalized
next word means somebody else (`@Ankit Torres` stays text when only "Ankit" is
known). An unresolved name consumes only its first word, so the rest of the
line is still scanned. Names are passed to the directory as written;
`MentionDirectory` implementations own case folding. The scanner lives in
`render::mention` so T07's Rocket.Chat renderer can reuse it with its own
broadcast names.
