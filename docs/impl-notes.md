# Implementation notes

Unexpected issues met while implementing [`tasks-plan.md`](tasks-plan.md), and
how they were solved. Newest entries go at the end of their task's section.
When a note changes a decision in the plan or the design, the same PR updates
that document too.

## T01: workspace skeleton

### reqwest 0.13 defaults to aws-lc-rs, not ring

**Issue.** The plan chose rustls on the `ring` provider. reqwest 0.13 made
`aws-lc-rs` its only built-in rustls provider: its `rustls` feature enables
`aws-lc-rs`, and the provider-free alternative, `rustls-no-provider`, panics
at `Client::new()` unless a provider is installed first (`reqwest`
`src/async_impl/client.rs`, `default_rustls_crypto_provider`). Staying on
`ring` would mean installing it before every client is built, including in
every library crate's tests.

**Solution.** Use reqwest's `rustls` feature, so `aws-lc-rs` is the one
provider in the tree. `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`
resolves to the same provider, and `cargo tree` shows no `ring`, `openssl-sys`
or `native-tls`. A probe build with reqwest, tokio-tungstenite, sqlx (SQLite)
and bollard compiled in 32 seconds on this machine. `aws-lc-sys` needs a C
compiler (and `cmake` on some targets), which the GitHub Ubuntu runners have.

Consequences:

- The workspace declares reqwest with `default-features = false` and only
  `json`. Crates that talk HTTPS add the `rustls` feature. `agentctl` talks
  plain HTTP to `agentctl.internal` and doesn't, so its static musl build
  stays free of C code.
- T02's license policy has to allow the `OpenSSL` license for `aws-lc-sys`
  (its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND OpenSSL`) as a
  per-crate exception.
- The plan's Libraries table and T02 are updated to match.

### Toolchain

The container's `stable` toolchain was 1.94, older than the workspace's
`rust-version` (1.98.1), so `cargo` refused to build. Run
`rustup default 1.98.1` (or newer) first. CI installs the current stable,
which is newer.

### cargo-llvm-cov ignores `default-members`

**Issue.** The plan relied on `default-members = [".", "crates/*"]` to make
the existing `cargo coverage` alias cover every crate. `cargo test` honors it,
and every crate's tests ran under coverage, but `cargo llvm-cov` still
reported only the root package's files. The gate would have measured
`src/lib.rs` alone.

**Solution.** Add `--workspace` to the `coverage` alias in
`.cargo/config.toml`, and to the CI step that prints the summary
(`cargo llvm-cov report --workspace --summary-only`). The report now lists
every crate.

## T03: core-types

### The `Surface` trait's `Sender` has no runtime to come from

**Issue.** The design's trait takes `tx: Sender<InboundEvent>`, which reads
as a `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender`. T03 limits core-types to `serde`,
`serde_json`, `uuid`, `time`, `thiserror` and `async-trait`, so no runtime's
channel is available. `std::sync::mpsc` blocks, which an async surface must
not do.

**Solution.** core-types defines `Sender<T>`, a cloneable handle over an
`Arc<dyn Sink<T>>`, where `Sink` is an `#[async_trait]` trait with one
method, `send(item) -> Result<(), SendError>`. The receiving side (agentd,
testkit's `MockSurface`) wraps its tokio sender in a small local type that
implements `Sink`. `SendError` converts to `SurfaceError::Closed`, so a
surface's event loop can end with `tx.send(event).await?`.

### `history` couldn't read a thread

**Issue.** The design's `history(&self, conv: &ConvRef, …)` names only a
conversation. Both of its callers read a thread: T23's turn message builder
("thread messages since the agent's last reply") and `agentctl history`
("more thread context"). Slack's `conversations.replies` and Rocket.Chat's
`chat.getThreadMessages` both need the thread root, which a `ConvRef` doesn't
carry.

**Solution.** `history` takes `thread: &ThreadKey`. A `ThreadKey` without a
root reads the conversation's top level, which is what a DM's continuous
session needs. The design's trait is updated to match. The rustdoc fixes the
order: at most `limit` messages, the newest ones older than `before`, oldest
first.

### `is_dm` couldn't tell a group DM from a channel

**Issue.** T22's router returns a `ScopeKind`, which has `GroupDm`, but
`InboundEvent` only had `is_dm: bool`. Nothing an event carried could produce
`GroupDm`.

**Solution.** `InboundEvent` has `conv_kind: ConvKind` (`Dm`, `GroupDm`,
`Channel`) instead, with an `is_dm()` method. T12 (Rocket.Chat room type `d`)
and T28 (Slack `channel_type`) are updated to set it.
`ScopeKey::for_conversation(kind, conv)` builds the matching scope.

### Key strings and separators inside platform ids

**Issue.** `dm:<surface>:<team>:<conv>` is ambiguous if an id contains `:`.
Slack's ids never do, but the Rocket.Chat "team" is whatever id agentd picks
for a server, and a `host:port` is a natural choice. A `/` in an id would
likewise break `VolumeKey`'s `<agent>/<scope>`.

**Solution.** Inside key strings, `%`, `:` and `/` in ids are written as
`%25`, `%3A` and `%2F`. Ids without them, which is every id Slack and
Rocket.Chat produce today, appear unchanged. Parsing accepts only what
`Display` writes (no lowercase or other escapes, and no raw `/`), and IDs
parse only in lowercase hyphenated form, so a key string that parses always
renders back to itself and one key never has two spellings in a database
column. A scope key never contains `/`, so it is safe as one path segment.
`MemberKey` and `ConvRef` have the same `<surface>:<team>:<id>` string form,
for columns such as T23's `requester_key`.

### `post` returns one `MsgRef`

**Issue.** T29's acceptance said `post` renders and splits through `render`,
but `post` returns a single `MsgRef`, and T23 records a `message_refs` row
for every chunk after calling `render` itself.

**Solution.** `Surface::post` sends one already-rendered chunk, as its
rustdoc says, and `Surface::render` does the converting and splitting. T29's
acceptance is reworded to test `render` instead.
