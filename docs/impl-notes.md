# Implementation notes

Unexpected issues met while implementing [`tasks-plan.md`](tasks-plan.md), and
how they were solved. Newest entries go at the end of their task's section.
When a note changes a decision in the plan or the design, the same PR updates
that document too.

## T01: workspace skeleton

### reqwest 0.13 defaults to aws-lc-rs, not ring

**Issue.** The plan chose rustls on the `ring` provider. reqwest 0.13 made
`aws-lc-rs` its only built-in rustls provider: its `rustls` feature enables
`aws-lc-rs`, and the provider-free alternative, `rustls-no-provider`, panics
at `Client::new()` unless a provider is installed first (`reqwest`
`src/async_impl/client.rs`, `default_rustls_crypto_provider`). Staying on
`ring` would mean installing it before every client is built, including in
every library crate's tests.

**Solution.** Use reqwest's `rustls` feature, so `aws-lc-rs` is the one
provider in the tree. `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`
resolves to the same provider, and `cargo tree` shows no `ring`, `openssl-sys`
or `native-tls`. A probe build with reqwest, tokio-tungstenite, sqlx (SQLite)
and bollard compiled in 32 seconds on this machine. `aws-lc-sys` needs a C
compiler (and `cmake` on some targets), which the GitHub Ubuntu runners have.

Consequences:

- The workspace declares reqwest with `default-features = false` and only
  `json`. Crates that talk HTTPS add the `rustls` feature. `agentctl` talks
  plain HTTP to `agentctl.internal` and doesn't, so its static musl build
  stays free of C code.
- T02's license policy has to allow the `OpenSSL` license for `aws-lc-sys`
  (its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND OpenSSL`) as a
  per-crate exception. (Superseded: current `aws-lc-sys` releases no longer
  use that license; see
  [T02](#aws-lc-sys-no-longer-needs-an-openssl-exception).)
- The plan's Libraries table and T02 are updated to match.

### cargo-llvm-cov ignores `default-members`

**Issue.** The plan relied on `default-members = [".", "crates/*"]` to make
the existing `cargo coverage` alias cover every crate. `cargo test` honors it,
and every crate's tests ran under coverage, but `cargo llvm-cov` still
reported only the root package's files. The gate would have measured
`src/lib.rs` alone.

**Solution.** Add `--workspace` to the `coverage` alias in
`.cargo/config.toml`, and to the CI step that prints the summary
(`cargo llvm-cov report --workspace --summary-only`). The report now lists
every crate.

## T02: dependency policy

### cargo-deny checks only the root package by default

**Issue.** The root `Cargo.toml` is a package as well as the workspace, not a
virtual manifest. For such a manifest cargo-deny makes the root package the
only root of the crate graph, so the member crates' dependencies are never
checked. The action's default arguments (`--all-features`) have this gap: a
throwaway commit adding `native-tls` to `agentd` passed `cargo deny check
bans`.

**Solution.** Pass `--workspace`, which makes every workspace member a root.
With it the same commit fails. cargo-deny has no configuration key for this,
so the CI job passes it through the action's `arguments`, and the README and
the header of `deny.toml` give the full local command. `all-features = true`
lives in `deny.toml`'s `[graph]` table, so local runs match CI without
repeating it. The job also passes `--locked`, so it checks the committed
`Cargo.lock` instead of silently re-resolving it.

### aws-lc-sys no longer needs an OpenSSL exception

**Issue.** The plan, following the T01 note, expected `aws-lc-sys` to need an
`OpenSSL` license exception. That was true up to `aws-lc-sys` 0.38. Since
0.39 its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND Apache-2.0 AND MIT AND
BSD-3-Clause AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT) AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT-0)`,
and `aws-lc-rs` 1.18, which reqwest 0.13.5 resolves to, requires
`aws-lc-sys` 0.45. An `OpenSSL` exception would never match, and cargo-deny
warns about unmatched exceptions.

**Solution.** No exception. The allowlist was derived from a scratch copy of
the workspace in which `agentd` depends on every crate in
`[workspace.dependencies]`, with reqwest's `rustls` feature, and each license
was kept only if removing it made `cargo deny --workspace check licenses`
fail. That gives MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause (`aws-lc-sys`, `matchit`,
`subtle`), ISC (`aws-lc-rs`, `aws-lc-sys`, `rustls-webpki`, `untrusted`),
Unicode-3.0 (the ICU crates and `unicode-ident`), Zlib (`foldhash`) and
CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (`webpki-root-certs`, pulled in by
`rustls-platform-verifier` through reqwest's `rustls` feature; `webpki-roots`
is not in the graph). BSD-2-Clause, which the plan listed, is not needed.
Today's lockfile uses only a few of these licenses, so `deny.toml` sets
`unused-allowed-license = "allow"` to keep CI free of warnings about the
rest.

### cargo-deny 0.20 has no warning level for unmaintained crates

**Issue.** The plan says `[advisories]` warns on unmaintained crates and that
`[licenses]` denies GPL, LGPL and AGPL. In cargo-deny 0.20 (the version the
action's `v2` tag ships) every advisory that applies is an error:
`unmaintained` only chooses the scope (`all`, `workspace`, `transitive`,
`none`) in which unmaintained advisories are reported at all. The
`[licenses] deny` list is deprecated and ignored: any license not in `allow`
or an exception is rejected.

**Solution.** `deny.toml` keeps `unmaintained = "all"`, and the CI job passes
`-W unmaintained` to `cargo deny check`, which lowers that one lint to a
warning. A scratch check with `paste` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436) passes with a
warning; one with `smallvec` 1.6.0 (RUSTSEC-2021-0003) still fails. GPL,
LGPL, AGPL and MPL-2.0 are rejected by being absent from `allow`; a scratch
path dependency carrying each of them failed `check licenses`, while
`MIT OR GPL-3.0-only` passed.

### The action's image ships Rust 1.85

**Issue.** `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2` runs in a `rust:1.85.0`
image, and cargo-deny runs that image's `cargo metadata`. Cargo 1.85 reads
today's manifests and lockfile, including the full dependency set, but it
predates the workspace's `rust-version` (1.98.1) and could fail on a
dependency that uses a newer manifest feature or edition.

**Solution.** The job sets the action's `rust-version: stable`, so the action
switches to the current stable toolchain before running cargo-deny, like the
other jobs.

## T03: core-types

### The `Surface` trait's `Sender` has no runtime to come from

**Issue.** The design's trait takes `tx: Sender<InboundEvent>`, which reads
as a `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender`. T03 limits core-types to `serde`,
`serde_json`, `uuid`, `time`, `thiserror` and `async-trait`, so no runtime's
channel is available. `std::sync::mpsc` blocks, which an async surface must
not do.

**Solution.** core-types defines `Sender<T>`, a cloneable handle over an
`Arc<dyn Sink<T>>`, where `Sink` is an `#[async_trait]` trait with one
method, `send(item) -> Result<(), SendError>`. The receiving side (agentd,
testkit's `MockSurface`) wraps its tokio sender in a small local type that
implements `Sink`. `SendError` converts to `SurfaceError::Closed`, so a
surface's event loop can end with `tx.send(event).await?`.

### `history` couldn't read a thread

**Issue.** The design's `history(&self, conv: &ConvRef, …)` names only a
conversation. Both of its callers read a thread: T23's turn message builder
("thread messages since the agent's last reply") and `agentctl history`
("more thread context"). Slack's `conversations.replies` and Rocket.Chat's
`chat.getThreadMessages` both need the thread root, which a `ConvRef` doesn't
carry.

**Solution.** `history` takes `thread: &ThreadKey`. A `ThreadKey` without a
root reads the conversation's top level, which is what a DM's continuous
session needs. The design's trait is updated to match. The rustdoc fixes the
order: at most `limit` messages, the newest ones older than `before`, oldest
first.

### `is_dm` couldn't tell a group DM from a channel

**Issue.** T22's router returns a `ScopeKind`, which has `GroupDm`, but
`InboundEvent` only had `is_dm: bool`. Nothing an event carried could produce
`GroupDm`.

**Solution.** `InboundEvent` has `conv_kind: ConvKind` (`Dm`, `GroupDm`,
`Channel`) instead, with an `is_dm()` method. T12 (Rocket.Chat room type `d`)
and T28 (Slack `channel_type`) are updated to set it.
`ScopeKey::for_conversation(kind, conv)` builds the matching scope.

### Key strings and separators inside platform ids

**Issue.** `dm:<surface>:<team>:<conv>` is ambiguous if an id contains `:`.
Slack's ids never do, but the Rocket.Chat "team" is whatever id agentd picks
for a server, and a `host:port` is a natural choice. A `/` in an id would
likewise break `VolumeKey`'s `<agent>/<scope>`.

**Solution.** Inside key strings, `%`, `:` and `/` in ids are written as
`%25`, `%3A` and `%2F`. Ids without them, which is every id Slack and
Rocket.Chat produce today, appear unchanged. Parsing accepts only what
`Display` writes (no lowercase or other escapes, and no raw `/`), and IDs
parse only in lowercase hyphenated form, so a key string that parses always
renders back to itself and one key never has two spellings in a database
column. A scope key never contains `/`, so it is safe as one path segment.
`MemberKey` and `ConvRef` have the same `<surface>:<team>:<id>` string form,
for columns such as T23's `requester_key`.

### `post` returns one `MsgRef`

**Issue.** T29's acceptance said `post` renders and splits through `render`,
but `post` returns a single `MsgRef`, and T23 records a `message_refs` row
for every chunk after calling `render` itself.

**Solution.** `Surface::post` sends one already-rendered chunk, as its
rustdoc says, and `Surface::render` does the converting and splitting. T29's
acceptance is reworded to test `render` instead.

## T06: Slack mrkdwn

### Escaping applies inside code too

**Issue.** T06 said to escape `&`, `<` and `>` "outside code", while its
acceptance criterion says code must come out "untouched except for escaping".
Slack reads its control sequences (`<!here>`, `<@U…>`, `<url|label>`) before
it applies any formatting, so an unescaped `<!here>` inside a code block still
notifies the channel. qm-core leaves code verbatim and has that hole.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` escapes the three characters everywhere, code
included, and changes nothing else inside code: no mention resolution, no
broadcast neutralization, no formatting. Slack shows `&lt;` as `<` inside code,
so the reader sees the original text. The T06 bullet in the plan now says
"everywhere".

### Literal Slack tokens are escaped, not passed through

**Issue.** qm-core passes literal wire tokens in model output through
unchanged (`<@U123>`, `<!subteam^S1>`, `<!date^…>`, `<https://x.io|label>`),
and only rewrites `<!here>`, `<!channel>` and `<!everyone>`. That lets model
output ping a whole user group, and it conflicts with escaping `<`.

**Solution.** The agent writes standard Markdown, and mentions go through the
`MentionDirectory`, as the design says. So every literal `<` is escaped, and
the tokens show as text. The broadcast forms still become qm-core's
`@\u{200B}here` text rather than escaped brackets, since the plan asks for
that. CommonMark parses `<https://x.io|label>` as an autolink whose URL
contains `|`; link URLs percent-encode `|` (and spaces), so it becomes
`<https://x.io%7Clabel>`. A link destination starting with `!`, `@` or `#` is
percent-encoded too, because `[x](<!here>)` would otherwise render as the
broadcast `<!here|x>`.

### Typed broadcasts get a zero-width space

**Issue.** qm-core leaves typed `@here`, `@channel` and `@everyone` alone. They
are inert only because qm-core posts without Slack's `link_names` flag.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` inserts U+200B after the `@` (outside code, ignoring
case, not after a letter or digit, so `me@here.com` is untouched). The output
is harmless whatever flags the Slack surface posts with, and it matches what
the wire forms become. These names are never offered to the directory, so a
member called "here" can't be pinged through them.

### Bare URLs get explicit bounds

**Issue.** T06 said bare URLs are "left alone". qm-core wraps them in `<…>`
because Slack's own URL detection pulled neighboring mrkdwn marks into the
link: `*https://x.io/#/device*` linked to `…/device*` (qm-core's
"device-code bug"). The Markdown parser strips the `**`, but the output puts
Slack's `*` right back next to the URL.

**Solution.** Bare `http://` and `https://` URLs in text become `<url>`, with
trailing punctuation and unmatched closing brackets left outside, as qm-core's
`trimUrlTail` does. Link labels and code are not scanned. `www.` addresses are
still left to Slack. The T06 bullet in the plan now says so.

### CommonMark disagrees with some qm-core regex cases

**Issue.** qm-core converts with regexes; this renderer walks the
`pulldown-cmark` tree, which follows CommonMark:

- `above\n---\nbelow` is a setext heading, not a rule.
- An unclosed fence runs to the end of the document instead of staying
  verbatim.
- A ```` ``` ```` run in the middle of a line is a code span, not a fence.
- Block spacing isn't in the event stream.

**Solution.** Follow the parse tree, and adapt the ported test cases, which
name each difference. Blocks are separated by a blank line when the source had
one between them (compared by source line numbers), and by a line break
otherwise, so `### Deep\nbody` still gives `*Deep*\nbody`. Fenced blocks keep
their info string, as qm-core and T07's fence reopening assume, even though
Slack doesn't highlight syntax. A code body that itself holds ```` ``` ````
keeps a `~~~` fence, like qm-core, because a backtick fence would close early.

### Unbounded nesting overflows the stack

**Issue.** `pulldown-cmark` emits a flat event stream, but any tree walk over
it recurses once per nesting level, and so does dropping the tree. A line of
100,000 `>` (or `*`) aborted the process with a stack overflow.

**Solution.** The tree builder keeps at most 64 levels (`MAX_DEPTH`). Elements
nested deeper are flattened into their ancestor at the limit: their text
stays, their markup is dropped. A test renders 100,000 levels on a test
thread's default stack.

### `@Name` grammar details

**Issue.** qm-core's `PLAIN_MENTION` regex relies on backtracking. When the
greedy one-to-three-word name runs into `/` or `@`, the regex retries shorter
matches, down to part of a word (`@ankit/x` tries `anki`). When nothing
resolves, it skips the whole matched run, so `@nobody https://x.io` never
wraps the URL.

**Solution.** `render::mention::scan` takes the greedy words, drops the last
word when it runs into `/` or `@` (a lone word then isn't a mention), and tries
the longest name first, as qm-core does, including its rule that a capitalized
next word means somebody else (`@Ankit Torres` stays text when only "Ankit" is
known). An unresolved name consumes only its first word, so the rest of the
line is still scanned. Names are passed to the directory as written;
`MentionDirectory` implementations own case folding. The scanner lives in
`render::mention` so T07's Rocket.Chat renderer can reuse it with its own
broadcast names.

## T11: Rocket.Chat REST

Server behavior below was read from the Rocket.Chat source on `develop`
(commit `fad30ab`, 8.8.x), where the REST API lives in
`apps/meteor/server/api/`, and checked against the 7.0.0 and 7.10.0 tags,
where it lives in `apps/meteor/app/api/server/`. No server was available to
run against, so none of it is verified live yet.

### `rooms.upload` is gone in Rocket.Chat 8.0

**Issue.** The plan names `rooms.upload/{rid}`. Rocket.Chat 8.0 removed it
(RocketChat/Rocket.Chat#36857 in `apps/meteor/CHANGELOG.md`). Its
replacement, `rooms.media/{rid}` followed by
`rooms.mediaConfirm/{rid}/{fileId}`, exists from 7.0 on. On 7.x,
`mediaConfirm` passes its whole body, less `description`, as `msgData` to
`sendFileMessage`, whose `check` rejects unknown keys, so `fileName` (which
8.x accepts and strips) breaks a 7.x upload.

**Solution.** `RestClient::upload` uses the two-step endpoints on every
version: a multipart `file` part carrying the name and a MIME type guessed
from the extension, then a confirm whose body is `{}` or `{"tmid": …}`.
`FakeRest` refuses confirm keys 7.x refuses. The T11 bullet in the plan now
names these endpoints.

### `users.createToken` needs a server secret, and its token expires

**Issue.** The plan says recent servers refuse `users.createToken` unless
started with `CREATE_TOKENS_FOR_USERS=true`. That was 6.x and 7.x, where the
endpoint was deprecated. Since 8.0 it takes a `secret` that must equal the
server's `CREATE_TOKENS_FOR_USERS_SECRET` environment variable, and the
caller needs `user-generate-access-token` for another user, which only
`admin` has by default (`apps/meteor/server/meteor-methods/auth/createToken.ts`,
`apps/meteor/server/lib/authorization/constant/permissions.ts`). It also
returns a login (resume) token, which expires after `Accounts_LoginExpiration`
(90 days by default) and counts against the user's login-token limit.

**Solution.** Use the other route, which works for a manager with only a
custom role: `RestClient::issue_bot_token` logs in as the bot with its random
password (`POST login`), calls `users.generatePersonalAccessToken`, then
`POST logout`s the login session. A personal access token doesn't expire. The
manager needs no permission for this step. The password is generated in
`create_bot_user`, held in a `BotPassword` that can't be cloned or
serialized, and consumed by `issue_bot_token`.

### The token route needs care around two-factor authentication

**Issue.** Three server behaviors get in the way of the login route:

- `users.generatePersonalAccessToken` is `twoFactorRequired`
  (`apps/meteor/server/api/v1/users.ts`). `checkCodeForUser`
  (`apps/meteor/server/lib/2fa/code/index.ts`) lets it through without a
  code only within `Accounts_TwoFactorAuthentication_RememberFor` (1800 s)
  of the user's creation, and only while the user has no 2FA method.
  Otherwise, with `Accounts_TwoFactorAuthentication_Enforce_Password_Fallback`
  on (the default), it wants `x-2fa-method: password` and
  `x-2fa-code: <sha256 hex of the password>`.
- With 2FA, email 2FA and `Accounts_TwoFactorAuthentication_By_Email_Auto_Opt_In`
  on (all defaults), every new user gets email 2FA enabled
  (`apps/meteor/server/lib/auth/startup.js`). It takes effect once the user
  has a verified email (`EmailCheck.isEnabled`). Then the password login
  itself asks for an emailed code (`apps/meteor/server/lib/2fa/loginHandler.ts`
  passes `disablePasswordFallback`), and the token endpoint picks email over
  the password fallback.
- `users.create` requires `email` (`packages/rest-typings/src/v1/users/UserCreateParamsPOST.ts`).

**Solution.** The bot is created with `verified: false` (the plan listed
`verified` without a value), so email 2FA never applies to it, and
`issue_bot_token` always sends the password-fallback headers, which the server
ignores when it doesn't need them. The token is created with
`bypassTwoFactor: true`: once the password is discarded the bot has no second
factor at all, so without it every 2FA-gated endpoint would fail for the bot
after the 30-minute grace period, and anyone holding the token can already act
as the bot. The caller supplies the email; T14 has to pick an address
(`<name>@<something>.invalid` passes the default checks). One case is left
for the live check: with `Accounts_EmailVerification` on (off by default),
password login refuses unverified emails (`validateLoginAttempt` in
`startup.js`), so such a server needs email 2FA auto opt-in off and
`verified: true`.

### What the server source says about the manager's custom role

**Issue.** The design leaves the custom role open. It stays open until the
live check, but the source narrows it down:

| Operation | Permission checked | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `users.create` | `create-user`; `assign-admin-role` only if `roles` contains `admin`. No `assign-roles`, no edit-user permission (RocketChat/Rocket.Chat#7351 no longer applies). | `apps/meteor/server/lib/users/saveUser/validateUserData.ts` |
| `users.create` with `active` | also `edit-other-user-active-status` (so `active` is never sent) | `executeSetUserActiveStatus`, called from `users.create` in `apps/meteor/server/api/v1/users.ts` |
| bot token (login route) | none for the manager; the bot needs `create-personal-access-tokens`, which defaults to `admin` and `user` only, so the admin must add it to the `bot` role | `apps/meteor/imports/personal-access-tokens/server/api/methods/generateToken.ts`, `permissions.ts` |
| `users.setActiveStatus` | `edit-other-user-active-status` or `manage-moderation-actions` | `users.ts` |
| `users.update` of another user | `edit-other-user-info`; the endpoint is also `twoFactorRequired`, so the manager's personal access token must be created with "Ignore Two Factor Authentication" | `validateUserData.ts`, `users.ts` |
| `users.setAvatar` of another user | `edit-other-user-avatar`; a bot may set its own while `Accounts_AllowUserAvatarChange` is on (default) | `users.ts` |
| `channels.invite`, `groups.invite` | `add-user-to-joined-room` in a room the manager is in, else `add-user-to-any-c-room` or `add-user-to-any-p-room` | `apps/meteor/server/meteor-methods/rooms/addUsersToRoom.ts` |

**Solution.** Recorded here for T14's live check and README. The minimal
role for create is `create-user`, plus the one-time admin change that grants
`create-personal-access-tokens` to `bot`. Delete (T14) adds
`edit-other-user-active-status`. The manager is subject to the REST rate
limiter (10 calls per route per minute per IP by default; `bot` bypasses it
through `api-bypass-rate-limit`), so the role should include
`api-bypass-rate-limit` once the manager bot posts DMs (T13). The design's
open question is left as it is until a server confirms this.

### `x-ratelimit-reset` is an absolute time in milliseconds

**Issue.** The header isn't a delay: `enforceRateLimit`
(`apps/meteor/server/api/ApiClass.ts`) sets it to `Date.now() + timeToReset`.
The body is `{"success": false, "error": "… [error-too-many-requests]"}`
without `errorType`. Meteor's DDP rate limiter, which guards `login`, instead
surfaces through the login route as HTTP 401 with `error: "too-many-requests"`
and no header.

**Solution.** The wait is the header minus the local clock, floored at zero,
and one second when the header is missing or unreadable. A 429, or either
code in any status, is retried once when the wait is at most
`with_max_retry_wait` (60 s by default, the server's default window);
otherwise, or on a second limit, the call fails with
`SurfaceError::RateLimited`. The 429 is raised before the endpoint runs, so
retrying a POST can't apply it twice.

### Error bodies put the code in different places

**Issue.** Meteor errors arrive as `error: "<reason> [<code>]"` plus
`errorType: "<code>"`. `API.v1.failure("<code>")` sends the code as `error`
with no `errorType`, `rooms.info` swaps them (`error: "not-allowed"`,
`errorType: "Not Allowed"`), and the permissions middleware sends 403 with
only `error: "… [error-unauthorized]"`. `error-unauthorized` thrown by a
handler becomes 403 today but 401 from 9.0 (`applyBreakingChanges` in
`ApiClass.ts`), the status that otherwise means a rejected token.

**Solution.** `map_error` collects candidate codes from `errorType`, a
space-free `error`, and a trailing `[code]`, and matches them against
permission codes (`Forbidden`) and missing-object codes (`NotFound`) before
looking at the status, so only a 401 without such a code means
`Unauthorized`. On a 401 a bare `error` isn't read as a code, since
`API.v1.unauthorized()` sends `error: "unauthorized"` for a rejected login.
Everything else is
`Api` with the server's description, cut to 200 characters. A body with
`success: false` is an error even on 200. A success body of the wrong shape
reports serde's error category and column, never the value, so message text
can't leak into the error.

### Smaller server behaviors the client works around

- `chat.react` toggles when `shouldReact` is absent
  (`apps/meteor/server/lib/messaging/reactions/setReaction.ts`), so a second
  `:eyes:` would remove the first. The client always sends `shouldReact: true`.
- `groups.history` includes thread replies unless `showThreadMessages=false`;
  `channels.history` and `im.history` exclude them unless it is `true`. The
  client always sends `false`, and `inclusive=false`.
- `latest` is parsed with JavaScript's `new Date`, and messages carry
  millisecond timestamps, so the client formats it like `toISOString`.
- `chat.postMessage` with a `roomId` joins a public channel the poster isn't
  in (`getRoomByNameOrIdWithOptionToJoin` with `joinChannel: true` in
  `apps/meteor/server/lib/messages/processWebhookMessage.ts`). T12 and T23
  should expect a bot to join a channel it posts to.
- `chat.getThreadMessages` has no `latest`. The client asks for newest first
  (`sort={"ts":-1}`) and pages by `offset`; `aroundId` exists only on newer
  servers. To turn a `Cursor` (a message id) into a `latest` time for the
  top level, the client also has `chat.getMessage`, which the plan didn't
  list.
