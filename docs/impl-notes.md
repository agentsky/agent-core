# Implementation notes

Unexpected issues met while implementing [`tasks-plan.md`](tasks-plan.md), and
how they were solved. Newest entries go at the end of their task's section.
When a note changes a decision in the plan or the design, the same PR updates
that document too.

## T01: workspace skeleton

### reqwest 0.13 defaults to aws-lc-rs, not ring

**Issue.** The plan chose rustls on the `ring` provider. reqwest 0.13 made
`aws-lc-rs` its only built-in rustls provider: its `rustls` feature enables
`aws-lc-rs`, and the provider-free alternative, `rustls-no-provider`, panics
at `Client::new()` unless a provider is installed first (`reqwest`
`src/async_impl/client.rs`, `default_rustls_crypto_provider`). Staying on
`ring` would mean installing it before every client is built, including in
every library crate's tests.

**Solution.** Use reqwest's `rustls` feature, so `aws-lc-rs` is the one
provider in the tree. `tokio-tungstenite` with `rustls-tls-native-roots`
resolves to the same provider, and `cargo tree` shows no `ring`, `openssl-sys`
or `native-tls`. A probe build with reqwest, tokio-tungstenite, sqlx (SQLite)
and bollard compiled in 32 seconds on this machine. `aws-lc-sys` needs a C
compiler (and `cmake` on some targets), which the GitHub Ubuntu runners have.

Consequences:

- The workspace declares reqwest with `default-features = false` and only
  `json`, `form` and `query` (reqwest 0.13 made `form` and `query` opt-in
  features). Crates that talk HTTPS add the `rustls` feature. `agentctl` talks
  plain HTTP to `agentctl.internal` and doesn't, so its static musl build
  stays free of C code.
- T02's license policy has to allow the `OpenSSL` license for `aws-lc-sys`
  (its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND OpenSSL`) as a
  per-crate exception. (Superseded: current `aws-lc-sys` releases no longer
  use that license; see
  [T02](#aws-lc-sys-no-longer-needs-an-openssl-exception).)
- The plan's Libraries table and T02 are updated to match.

### cargo-llvm-cov ignores `default-members`

**Issue.** The plan relied on `default-members = [".", "crates/*"]` to make
the existing `cargo coverage` alias cover every crate. `cargo test` honors it,
and every crate's tests ran under coverage, but `cargo llvm-cov` still
reported only the root package's files. The gate would have measured
`src/lib.rs` alone.

**Solution.** Add `--workspace` to the `coverage` alias in
`.cargo/config.toml`, and to the CI step that prints the summary
(`cargo llvm-cov report --workspace --summary-only`). The report now lists
every crate.

## T02: dependency policy

### cargo-deny checks only the root package by default

**Issue.** The root `Cargo.toml` is a package as well as the workspace, not a
virtual manifest. For such a manifest cargo-deny makes the root package the
only root of the crate graph, so the member crates' dependencies are never
checked. The action's default arguments (`--all-features`) have this gap: a
throwaway commit adding `native-tls` to `agentd` passed `cargo deny check
bans`.

**Solution.** Pass `--workspace`, which makes every workspace member a root.
With it the same commit fails. cargo-deny has no configuration key for this,
so the CI job passes it through the action's `arguments`, and the README and
the header of `deny.toml` give the full local command. `all-features = true`
lives in `deny.toml`'s `[graph]` table, so local runs match CI without
repeating it. The job also passes `--locked`, so it checks the committed
`Cargo.lock` instead of silently re-resolving it.

### aws-lc-sys no longer needs an OpenSSL exception

**Issue.** The plan, following the T01 note, expected `aws-lc-sys` to need an
`OpenSSL` license exception. That was true up to `aws-lc-sys` 0.38. Since
0.39 its expression is `ISC AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC) AND Apache-2.0 AND MIT AND
BSD-3-Clause AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT) AND (Apache-2.0 OR ISC OR MIT-0)`,
and `aws-lc-rs` 1.18, which reqwest 0.13.5 resolves to, requires
`aws-lc-sys` 0.45. An `OpenSSL` exception would never match, and cargo-deny
warns about unmatched exceptions.

**Solution.** No exception. The allowlist was derived from a scratch copy of
the workspace in which `agentd` depends on every crate in
`[workspace.dependencies]`, with reqwest's `rustls` feature, and each license
was kept only if removing it made `cargo deny --workspace check licenses`
fail. That gives MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-3-Clause (`aws-lc-sys`, `matchit`,
`subtle`), ISC (`aws-lc-rs`, `aws-lc-sys`, `rustls-webpki`, `untrusted`),
Unicode-3.0 (the ICU crates and `unicode-ident`), Zlib (`foldhash`) and
CDLA-Permissive-2.0 (`webpki-root-certs`, pulled in by
`rustls-platform-verifier` through reqwest's `rustls` feature; `webpki-roots`
is not in the graph). BSD-2-Clause, which the plan listed, is not needed.
Today's lockfile uses only a few of these licenses, so `deny.toml` sets
`unused-allowed-license = "allow"` to keep CI free of warnings about the
rest.

### cargo-deny 0.20 has no warning level for unmaintained crates

**Issue.** The plan says `[advisories]` warns on unmaintained crates and that
`[licenses]` denies GPL, LGPL and AGPL. In cargo-deny 0.20 (the version the
action's `v2` tag ships) every advisory that applies is an error:
`unmaintained` only chooses the scope (`all`, `workspace`, `transitive`,
`none`) in which unmaintained advisories are reported at all. The
`[licenses] deny` list is deprecated and ignored: any license not in `allow`
or an exception is rejected.

**Solution.** `deny.toml` keeps `unmaintained = "all"`, and the CI job passes
`-W unmaintained` to `cargo deny check`, which lowers that one lint to a
warning. A scratch check with `paste` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436) passes with a
warning; one with `smallvec` 1.6.0 (RUSTSEC-2021-0003) still fails. GPL,
LGPL, AGPL and MPL-2.0 are rejected by being absent from `allow`; a scratch
path dependency carrying each of them failed `check licenses`, while
`MIT OR GPL-3.0-only` passed.

### The action's image ships Rust 1.85

**Issue.** `EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny-action@v2` runs in a `rust:1.85.0`
image, and cargo-deny runs that image's `cargo metadata`. Cargo 1.85 reads
today's manifests and lockfile, including the full dependency set, but it
predates the workspace's `rust-version` (1.98.1) and could fail on a
dependency that uses a newer manifest feature or edition.

**Solution.** The job sets the action's `rust-version: stable`, so the action
switches to the current stable toolchain before running cargo-deny, like the
other jobs.

### `[licenses.private]` exempts any unpublished crate

**Issue.** `[licenses.private] ignore = true` is meant to exempt our own
crates, which carry only `license-file`. cargo-deny applies it to every crate
with `publish = false`, wherever it comes from. A scratch copy of the
workspace in which `agentd` depends on `vendor/gpl`, a path crate with
`license = "GPL-3.0-only"` and `publish = false`, printed `licenses ok`.
cargo-deny has no setting that limits the exemption to workspace members:
`[licenses.private]` only adds private registries, `[sources]` does not see
path dependencies, and a `[[licenses.clarify]]` entry per workspace crate
would have to be added for every new crate and pinned to the hash of
`LICENSE`.

**Solution.** Keep `private.ignore` and add `scripts/ci/check-path-deps.sh`,
which the `deny` job runs before cargo-deny. It reads
`cargo metadata --locked --all-features --format-version 1` and fails when a
package with no source (a path package) has a manifest other than the root
`Cargo.toml` or `crates/<name>/Cargo.toml`. Matching the manifest path, not
the `workspace_members` list, also rejects a vendored crate added to
`[workspace] members` outside `crates/`. The same scratch case fails the
script, as do a path dependency outside the repository, an optional one
behind a feature, a Windows-only one, one nested under
`crates/agentd/vendor/`, and a `[patch.crates-io]` entry pointing at a local
copy; with a stale lockfile, `--locked` makes it fail too. A crate placed
directly in `crates/` is a workspace crate by the layout rules in
`AGENTS.md`, so it is reviewed as our code.

### The `deny` job ran only when code changed

**Issue.** The `deny` job runs only when the `changes` job classifies a
change as code. An advisory published against a crate already in
`Cargo.lock` therefore surfaced on the next code pull request, unrelated to
it, rather than when it was published.

**Solution.** The workflow gains a weekly `schedule` trigger (Mondays at
04:23 UTC). The `changes` job sets a base commit only for `pull_request` and
`push` events, so a scheduled run is classified as code and runs every job,
which also catches breakage from a new stable toolchain. `publish-badges`
still runs only on pushes to `main` and manual dispatches, and the `docs`
job's badge check only on pushes to `main`. Scheduled runs take a
concurrency group of their own: in `main`'s group, where
`cancel-in-progress` is false, a scheduled run arriving while a push run is
pending would cancel that pending run, and its badges would not be
published. GitHub runs schedules on the default branch only, so the trigger
takes effect once this workflow is on `main`. GitHub also disables
`schedule` triggers in a public repository after 60 days without repository
activity, so on a quiet repository the weekly advisory run can stop and has
to be re-enabled from the Actions tab.

## T03: core-types

### The `Surface` trait's `Sender` has no runtime to come from

**Issue.** The design's trait takes `tx: Sender<InboundEvent>`, which reads
as a `tokio::sync::mpsc::Sender`. T03 limits core-types to `serde`,
`serde_json`, `uuid`, `time`, `thiserror` and `async-trait`, so no runtime's
channel is available. `std::sync::mpsc` blocks, which an async surface must
not do.

**Solution.** core-types defines `Sender<T>`, a cloneable handle over an
`Arc<dyn Sink<T>>`, where `Sink` is an `#[async_trait]` trait with one
method, `send(item) -> Result<(), SendError>`. The receiving side (agentd,
testkit's `MockSurface`) wraps its tokio sender in a small local type that
implements `Sink`. `SendError` converts to `SurfaceError::Closed`, so a
surface's event loop can end with `tx.send(event).await?`.

### `history` couldn't read a thread

**Issue.** The design's `history(&self, conv: &ConvRef, …)` names only a
conversation. Both of its callers read a thread: T23's turn message builder
("thread messages since the agent's last reply") and `agentctl history`
("more thread context"). Slack's `conversations.replies` and Rocket.Chat's
`chat.getThreadMessages` both need the thread root, which a `ConvRef` doesn't
carry.

**Solution.** `history` takes `thread: &ThreadKey`. A `ThreadKey` without a
root reads the conversation's top level, which is what a DM's continuous
session needs. The design's trait is updated to match. The rustdoc fixes the
order: at most `limit` messages, the newest ones older than `before`, oldest
first.

### `is_dm` couldn't tell a group DM from a channel

**Issue.** T22's router returns a `ScopeKind`, which has `GroupDm`, but
`InboundEvent` only had `is_dm: bool`. Nothing an event carried could produce
`GroupDm`.

**Solution.** `InboundEvent` has `conv_kind: ConvKind` (`Dm`, `GroupDm`,
`Channel`) instead, with an `is_dm()` method. T12 (Rocket.Chat room type `d`)
and T28 (Slack `channel_type`) are updated to set it.
`ScopeKey::for_conversation(kind, conv)` builds the matching scope.

### Key strings and separators inside platform ids

**Issue.** `dm:<surface>:<team>:<conv>` is ambiguous if an id contains `:`.
Slack's ids never do, but the Rocket.Chat "team" is whatever id agentd picks
for a server, and a `host:port` is a natural choice. A `/` in an id would
likewise break `VolumeKey`'s `<agent>/<scope>`.

**Solution.** Inside key strings, `%`, `:` and `/` in ids are written as
`%25`, `%3A` and `%2F`. Ids without them, which is every id Slack and
Rocket.Chat produce today, appear unchanged. Parsing accepts only what
`Display` writes (no lowercase or other escapes, and no raw `/`), and IDs
parse only in lowercase hyphenated form, so a key string that parses always
renders back to itself and one key never has two spellings in a database
column. A scope key never contains `/`, which keeps `VolumeKey`'s single
separator unambiguous; it is still not a safe file name (see
[below](#scope-keys-are-not-file-or-docker-names)). `MemberKey` and `ConvRef` have the same `<surface>:<team>:<id>` string form,
for columns such as T23's `requester_key`.

### `post` returns one `MsgRef`

**Issue.** T29's acceptance said `post` renders and splits through `render`,
but `post` returns a single `MsgRef`, and T23 records a `message_refs` row
for every chunk after calling `render` itself.

**Solution.** `Surface::post` sends one already-rendered chunk, as its
rustdoc says, and `Surface::render` does the converting and splitting. T29's
acceptance is reworded to test `render` instead.

### The scope lock had no lease id

**Issue.** `LockResponse::Held` carried only an expiry, and renew and
release named no lease: the server could match them only by session. Claude
Code runs Bash tool calls in parallel, so one session can run two
`agentctl lock -- …` at once. Both would get `Held`, and when the first
command exited its `Release` would free the lock while the second command
was still writing to `shared/`.

**Solution.** A new `LeaseId` (a UUID newtype like the other ids) is minted
on every acquire and returned in `LockResponse::Held { lease, expires_at }`.
`LockRequest` is now an enum tagged by `op`, with `Renew { lease }` and
`Release { lease }`, so a renew or release without a lease fails to
deserialize. The lock is exclusive per lease, not per session: a second
acquire, from any session, gets `Busy`, and a renew or release naming any
lease but the current one answers `Released` and changes nothing. T15's
`scope_locks` table takes `lease_id` as its primary key next to
`holder_session`, and its acceptance tests the same-session case.

### Scope keys are not file or Docker names

**Issue.** `ScopeKey`'s rustdoc called its string "safe as one path
segment" because it never contains `/`. It always contains `:`, and may
contain `%` and any other character a platform id holds. A `:` splits a
bollard `binds` entry (`src:dst:ro`), and Docker volume names allow only
`[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*`, so a sandbox that named a directory or a
Docker volume after the key would break or be refused.

**Solution.** The rustdoc of `ScopeKey` and `VolumeKey` now says the string
is a key for columns, labels and logs, not a file or Docker object name. T17
in the plan fixes how volumes are named and mounted: host directories at
`volumes/<agent id>/<lowercase hex SHA-256 of the scope key>` in the agentd
data directory, mounted through bollard's `Mounts` API (`HostConfig::mounts`,
type `bind`), never `binds` strings or named Docker volumes. A digest was
chosen over a reversible encoding of the key (hex or base32), which grows
with the key and could pass the 255-byte file-name limit for a long
Rocket.Chat team id; the `volumes` table records which key a directory holds.

### A Slack bot message may name no user

**Issue.** `InboundEvent::sender` is a required `MemberKey`, but a Slack bot
message may carry only a `bot_id` and no `user`, and the router's
managed-bot lookup (T22) needs one key to look up. The plan did not say what
`sender.user` holds then, or whether the router keys on `sender` or on
`sender_bot_user`.

**Solution.** The router keys on `sender` when `sender_is_bot` is true, and a
surface puts the bot's user id in both `sender.user` and `sender_bot_user`,
so they never disagree: `u._id` on Rocket.Chat, and on Slack the event's
`user`, or the `user_id` from `bots.info` (T29) when the event has only a
`bot_id`. A bot with no known user id keeps its `bot_id` in `sender.user` and
has `sender_bot_user: None`; no binding has that id, so the router ignores
it as an unmanaged bot. `InboundEvent`'s rustdoc has a "Bot senders"
section saying this, and T12, T22, T28 and T29 in the plan match it.

## T06: Slack mrkdwn

### Escaping applies inside code too

**Issue.** T06 said to escape `&`, `<` and `>` "outside code", while its
acceptance criterion says code must come out "untouched except for escaping".
Slack reads its control sequences (`<!here>`, `<@U…>`, `<url|label>`) before
it applies any formatting, so an unescaped `<!here>` inside a code block still
notifies the channel. qm-core leaves code verbatim and has that hole.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` escapes the three characters everywhere, code
included, and changes nothing else inside code: no mention resolution, no
broadcast neutralization, no formatting. Slack shows `&lt;` as `<` inside code,
so the reader sees the original text. The T06 bullet in the plan now says
"everywhere".

### Literal Slack tokens are escaped, not passed through

**Issue.** qm-core passes literal wire tokens in model output through
unchanged (`<@U123>`, `<!subteam^S1>`, `<!date^…>`, `<https://x.io|label>`),
and only rewrites `<!here>`, `<!channel>` and `<!everyone>`. That lets model
output ping a whole user group, and it conflicts with escaping `<`.

**Solution.** The agent writes standard Markdown, and mentions go through the
`MentionDirectory`, as the design says. So every literal `<` is escaped, and
the tokens show as text. The broadcast forms still become qm-core's
`@\u{200B}here` text rather than escaped brackets, since the plan asks for
that. CommonMark parses `<https://x.io|label>` as an autolink whose URL
contains `|`; link URLs percent-encode `|` (and spaces), so it becomes
`<https://x.io%7Clabel>`. A link destination starting with `!`, `@` or `#` is
percent-encoded too, because `[x](<!here>)` would otherwise render as the
broadcast `<!here|x>`.

### Typed broadcasts get a zero-width space

**Issue.** qm-core leaves typed `@here`, `@channel` and `@everyone` alone. They
are inert only because qm-core posts without Slack's `link_names` flag.

**Solution.** `to_mrkdwn` inserts U+200B after the `@` (outside code, ignoring
case, not after a letter or digit, so `me@here.com` is untouched), which
matches what the wire forms become. These names are never offered to the
directory, so a member called "here" can't be pinged through them.

This does not make the output safe under every posting flag. With
`link_names=1` (or `parse=full`) Slack would still link an unresolved `@devs`
that stays text, and ping that user group, and code keeps a typed `@here`
as written. Rewriting every unresolved `@word` would mangle ordinary text, so
the renderer relies on the Slack surface never setting either flag. T29's
deliverables and acceptance in the plan now say so.

### Bare URLs get explicit bounds

**Issue.** T06 said bare URLs are "left alone". qm-core wraps them in `<…>`
because Slack's own URL detection pulled neighboring mrkdwn marks into the
link: `*https://x.io/#/device*` linked to `…/device*` (qm-core's
"device-code bug"). The Markdown parser strips the `**`, but the output puts
Slack's `*` right back next to the URL.

**Solution.** Bare `http://` and `https://` URLs in text become `<url>`, with
trailing punctuation and unmatched closing brackets left outside, as qm-core's
`trimUrlTail` does. Link labels and code are not scanned. `www.` addresses are
still left to Slack. The T06 bullet in the plan now says so.

### Emphasis inside a bare URL cut the link

**Issue.** CommonMark reads `_…_`, `__…__`, `*…*` and `~~…~~` inside a URL's
path as emphasis, so pulldown-cmark splits the URL's text around it, and a
scan of one text node linked only the part before:
`see https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html` became
`see <https://docs.python.org/3/library/>*main*.html`. qm-core's regex pass
kept such URLs whole.

**Solution.** While parsing, the renderer measures each bare URL in the source
from where a text node starts it, and ends it early where the rendered text
stops being a URL: at a character reference or escape that renders as a
space, `<`, `>` or `|` (`&lt;`), and at anything other than text and
emphasis, such as inline code. Emphasis or strikethrough whose opening
delimiter is inside such a range is replaced by its children, with its
delimiters as text, so the URL is one text run again and is linked whole.
Markup that opens before a URL wraps it and is not touched, even when the
source runs on past its closing delimiter: `**https://x.io/a**'s` stays bold,
as `*<https://x.io/a>*'s`.

### CommonMark disagrees with some qm-core regex cases

**Issue.** qm-core converts with regexes; this renderer walks the
`pulldown-cmark` tree, which follows CommonMark:

- `above\n---\nbelow` is a setext heading, not a rule.
- An unclosed fence runs to the end of the document instead of staying
  verbatim.
- A ```` ``` ```` run in the middle of a line is a code span, not a fence.
- Block spacing isn't in the event stream.

**Solution.** Follow the parse tree, and adapt the ported test cases, which
name each difference. Blocks are separated by a blank line when the source had
one between them (compared by source line numbers), and by a line break
otherwise, so `### Deep\nbody` still gives `*Deep*\nbody`. Fenced blocks keep
their info string, as qm-core and T07's fence reopening assume, even though
Slack doesn't highlight syntax. A code body that itself holds ```` ``` ````
still gets a backtick fence (see
[Backtick runs close a Slack code block](#backtick-runs-close-a-slack-code-block)).

### Unbounded nesting overflows the stack

**Issue.** `pulldown-cmark` emits a flat event stream, but any tree walk over
it recurses once per nesting level, and so does dropping the tree. A line of
100,000 `>` (or `*`) aborted the process with a stack overflow.

**Solution.** The tree builder keeps at most 64 levels (`MAX_DEPTH`). Elements
nested deeper are flattened into their ancestor at the limit: their text
stays, their markup is dropped. A test renders 100,000 levels on a test
thread's default stack.

### `@Name` grammar details

**Issue.** qm-core's `PLAIN_MENTION` regex relies on backtracking. When the
greedy one-to-three-word name runs into `/` or `@`, the regex retries shorter
matches, down to part of a word (`@ankit/x` tries `anki`). When nothing
resolves, it skips the whole matched run, so `@nobody https://x.io` never
wraps the URL.

**Solution.** `render::mention::scan` takes the greedy words, drops the last
word when it runs into `/` or `@` (a lone word then isn't a mention), and tries
the longest name first, as qm-core does, including its rule that a capitalized
next word means somebody else (`@Ankit Torres` stays text when only "Ankit" is
known). An unresolved name consumes only its first word, so the rest of the
line is still scanned. Names are passed to the directory as written;
`MentionDirectory` implementations own case folding. The scanner lives in
`render::mention` so T07's Rocket.Chat renderer can reuse it with its own
broadcast names.

### A link label can disguise its destination

**Issue.** `[https://good.com](https://evil.com)` became
`<https://evil.com|https://good.com>`: Slack shows `https://good.com` and
opens `evil.com`. Model output is untrusted (a prompt injection can write the
link), so a label must not be able to name a different site than the link.

**Solution.** Before writing `<url|label>`, the renderer takes the label as
plain text and looks at each word. A word with a `scheme://` or `mailto:`
prefix, or one shaped like a domain name (two or more dot-separated labels of
letters, digits and `-` ending in an alphabetic or `xn--` label, including
`user@host` addresses) or an IPv4 address, names a host. The authority ends at
`/`, `?`, `#` or `\`, as in browsers, and the host is what follows its last
`@`. Hosts are compared after dropping the port and a trailing dot, dropping
default-ignorable characters (zero-width spaces, soft hyphens, bidirectional
controls: they render as nothing and could hide a dot from the check), mapping
dot look-alikes (`。`, `．`, `｡`, `﹒`, `․`) to `.`, lowercasing, and dropping
a leading `www.`. When any named host differs from the URL's, the label is
written as text next to a bare link, `https://good.com (<https://evil.com>)`,
the same shape table cells already use. The label's text stays unarmed, as in
a link; if Slack links a URL in it on its own, that link shows its own
destination, so nothing needs neutralizing. Images get the same check on their
alt text. Autolinks have no separate label, and email autolinks pass because
the address and the `mailto:` URL name the same host.

The check errs toward showing the URL. There is no IDNA mapping, so a Unicode
label and its punycode URL (`bücher.de`, `https://xn--bcher-kva.de`) count as
different, and so do a domain and its subdomains. File names whose extension
is also a top-level domain (`main.rs`, `README.md`) look like domains, so
`[main.rs](https://github.com/…)` becomes `main.rs (<https://github.com/…>)`.
A homoglyph URL (`https://аpple.com` with a Cyrillic `а`) is still shown as
written; the check only stops a label from vouching for it.

### Slack doesn't format inside a word

**Issue.** CommonMark lets `*` emphasis start or end inside a word, so `5*3*2`
and `a*b*c` parse as emphasis. Rendering it as `_3_` gave `5_3_2`, which Slack
doesn't format either, since it only formats at word boundaries: the reader saw
underscores where the agent wrote asterisks. qm-core's regex leaves both
alone.

**Solution.** Emphasis, strong emphasis and strikethrough directly preceded or
followed by a letter or digit in the source keep their Markdown delimiter
character, once on each side, and their contents render without that style:
`5*3*2` → `5*3*2`, and `foo**bar**baz` → `foo*bar*baz`, which is also what
qm-core produces. Doubling the delimiter back to `**` would leave an inner
`*bar*` pair that Slack could format. `_` can't open or close emphasis inside
a word in CommonMark, so `snake_case_name` was already text.

### Backslash escapes have no Slack equivalent

**Issue.** `\*not bold\*` parses as the literal text `*not bold*`, and
Slack then bolds it; the same goes for `_`, `~` and `` ` ``, and for character
references such as `&ast;`. Slack's mrkdwn has no escape character.

**Solution.** pulldown-cmark starts a new text event at each escaped
character, so the tree builder records the offset of any text event that
begins with one of `*`, `_`, `~` or `` ` `` and either follows a backslash or
differs from its source (a character reference). Outside code those
characters get U+200B on both sides, which keeps them from opening or closing
Slack formatting if Slack treats U+200B as a word character or as a space.
(If it treated it as punctuation, no invisible character could help.) A
character with a letter or digit on both sides is left alone, because
Slack wouldn't format there and the zero-width space could act as a boundary
that lets it. Image alt text is plain text, so every such character in it is
treated as escaped. Table cells render inside a code block and need nothing.
A literal `*` right after an escaped backslash (`\\* x`) counts as escaped
too, which only adds zero-width spaces. Slack's exact boundary rules aren't
documented, so T29's live check should confirm this renders as intended.

### Backtick runs close a Slack code block

**Issue.** A code body holding ```` ``` ```` used to get a `~~~` fence, as in
qm-core. Slack doesn't know tilde fences, so the whole block rendered as
mrkdwn and the inner ```` ``` ```` opened a real code block.

**Solution.** Code blocks and tables always use a backtick fence. Slack closes
a code block at any run of three backticks and has no escape, so a U+200B goes
before every third backtick in a row inside the block, and before a backtick
that starts the info string. The block shows the same characters, but copying
it out carries the zero-width spaces along.

### A link with an empty URL

**Issue.** `[x]()` rendered as `<|x>`, which Slack doesn't parse as a link.

**Solution.** A link or image whose URL is empty shows only its label (`x`),
and nothing when the label is empty too. Table cells show just the label as
well, instead of `x ()`.

### Wire broadcast labels are searched a bounded distance

**Issue.** Each `<!here|` looked for its closing `>` to the end of the text,
so a message of many `<!here|` without `>` took quadratic time: 210 KB took
0.2 s.

**Solution.** The `>` must come within 256 bytes (`MAX_WIRE_LABEL`) and before
a line break. A longer or unclosed token stays escaped text (`&lt;!here|…`),
which is just as harmless. A test renders 2.1 MB of unclosed `<!here|` under a
time limit that the quadratic version exceeds several times over.

### Code spans holding backticks

**Issue.** Slack ends inline code at the next backtick and has no escape, so
a code span that holds one (``` `` a`b `` ```) renders as `` `a`b` ``, and
Slack shows `a` as code followed by a stray `` b` ``. qm-core has the same
limit.

**Solution.** Left as is. A zero-width space doesn't stop a backtick from
closing inline code, and replacing the backtick with a look-alike would change
the code's text. Agents rarely put backticks in inline code; a fenced block
shows them correctly.
